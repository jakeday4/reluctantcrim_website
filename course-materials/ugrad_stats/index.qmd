The following assignments were created for Jon's undergraduate statistics course (CJUS K300) with the help of Tyeisha Fordham, a PhD student at Indiana University. Here is an abridged [syllabus](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Syllabus/CJUS-K300_syllabus_abridged.pdf) for the course. Most of the assignments are based on exercises found in [Bachman, Paternoster, & Wilson’s Statistics for Criminology & Criminal Justice, 5th Ed.](https://edge.sagepub.com/bachmansccj5e), which we refer to throughout as "BPW" book.

This course is designed as a (relatively) gentle introduction to elementary foundations of frequentist statistics using R via R Studio & R Markdown. Though initially designed for undergraduate students, the course is comparable to many introductory statistics courses that graduate students take in pursuit of Masters or PhD degrees in criminology/criminal justice. It may also provide a helpful bridge for graduate students prior to taking more advanced statistics courses that use R and, likewise, may be useful for criminologists at any educational or career stages interested in learning to use R for the first time.

### [Assignment 1: Getting Started in R](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_1_JRB.html)
The purpose of this first assignment is to demonstrate that you have downloaded the “base R” and “RStudio” statistical programs and can open a SPSS datafile in RStudio. Additionally, you will learn how to create, edit, and knit an R Markdown file.

### [Assignment 2: Navigating Data](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_2_JRB.html)
In this assignment, you will create an R Markdown file in which to save and present your work for this class. Additionally, following the goals of BPW's chapter 1, you will use R/RStudio to view variables in a data file and find information about variables, including variable names, labels, and values. This assignment should help you navigate R/RStudio and become comfortable finding basic information within data files.

### [Assignment 3: Describing Data Distributions](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_3_JRB.html)
Chapters 2 & 3 of B&P's book focused on data distributions and displaying data with tabular or graphical representations. In this assignment, you will learn how to recode variables, generate frequency tables, and create simple graphs in R.

### [Assignment 4: Central Tendency](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_4_JRB.html)
BPW's chapter 4 focused on measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, and mode,) and their advantages and disadvantages as single statistical descriptions of a data distribution. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to use R to calculate measures of central tendency and other statistics (e.g., skewness; kurtosis) that us help standardize and efficiently describe the shape of a data distribution. You will also get additional practice with creating frequency tables and simple graphs in R.

### [Assignment 5: Dispersion](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_5_JRB.html)
BPW's chapter 5 covered measures of dispersion, including variation ratio, range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation. We use measures of dispersion to summarize the “spread” (rather than central tendency) of a data distribution. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to use R to calculate measures of dispersion and create boxplots that help us standardize and efficiently describe the spread of a data distribution. You will also get additional practice with creating frequency tables and simple graphs in R, and you will learn how to modify some elements (e.g., color) of a ggplot object.

### [Assignment 6: Probability & Cross-tabulations](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_6_JRB.html)
BPW's chapter 6 provided an introduction to probability, including foundational rules of probability and probability distributions. In the current assignment, you will gain a better understanding of frequentist probability by learning to create and interpret cross-tabulations or joint frequency contingency tables and by calculating z-scores.

### [Assignment 7: Sampling Variability & Confidence Intervals](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_7_JRB.html)
In this assignment, we dig deeper into the process of making statistical inferences about population parameters from sample statistics. For instance, you will learn to think about sample descriptive statistics (e.g., a sample mean or correlation coefficient) as point estimates of population parameters. Relatedly, following BPW's chapter 7, you will learn how to calculate confidence intervals around a point estimate in R and to interpret them appropriately. Additionally, you will learn how to simulate data from a probability distribution, which should help you better understand sampling variability and the need for interval estimates.

### [Assignment 8: One-sample Null Hypothesis Test](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_8_JRB.html)
Following BPW's chapter 8, in this assignment you will learn how to conduct a two-tail *z*-test and *t*-test and then, given the test results and the null hypothesis, to make an appropriate inference about the population parameter by either rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. Along the way, you will explore plots of data distributions from random samples drawn from simulated population data. This exploration is intended to help you visualize the sampling distribution of a sample mean, which should lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that allow us to make valid population inferences from samples with null hypothesis significance testing.

### [Assignment 9: Chi-squared Test of Independence](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_9_JRB.html)
As in BPW's chapter 9, in this assignment you will learn how to make population inferences about the relationship between two categorical variables by conducting a chi-squared test of independence on a sample contingency table (crosstab). Additionally, we will briefly introduce you to the phi-coefficient and Cramer’s V, two measures of association that can be interpreted to describe the strength of an association between variables in a crosstab.

### [Assignment 10: Two-sample Null Hypothesis Test](ugrad-stats_Rassign/Assignment_10_JRB.html)
BPW's chapter 10 focused on null hypothesis tests to make inferences about the equality of two group means or proportions using sample data. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to make an inference about the (in)equality of two population group means by conducting an independent sample t-test and then determining whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in population group means. We will also use simulations to visualize the sampling distribution of sample mean differences, briefly introduce Levene’s test of equality of population group variances, and introduce the half-violin/half-dotplot as a way to visualize variable distributions and potential outliers for two (or more) groups.
