## About the Reluctant Criminologists
:::

Welcome to our site! We are [Jon Brauer](https://www.jonbrauer.com) and [Jake Day](https://www.jacobcday.com/), aka the "Reluctant Criminologists."

The name of our site pays homage to our late mentor and friend, Dr. Charles R. Tittle. Specifically, it is a reference to his  chapter entitled "Reflections of a Reluctant but Committed Criminologist" in Gilbert Geis and Mary Dodge's [*Lessons of Criminology*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781315721507/lessons-criminology-gilbert-geis-mary-dodge) (pp.23-45). 

This is one of our favorite pieces written by Charles. Our perspectives on the field of criminology and criminal justice are quite comparable to the views he presents in that chapter, and our site's mission is, in essence, an answer to the call he lays out for our field. With that said, here is how that chapter starts (p.23):

"I didn't intend to become a criminologist. Rather, happenstance led me to investigate certain sociological problems that resulted in my being labeled a criminologist (Tittle, 1991). After a while the reactions of others had the effects that symbolic interactionist theory would predict - I began to think of myself as a criminologist, although one with a larger allegiance. In fact, one of the first conclusions I drew as a criminologist is that criminology ought not be thought of as a discipline. Disciplines have unifying perspectives; criminology does not. Criminology is an umbrella term encompassing diverse studies of crime and crime-relevant phenomena undertaken from many disciplinary points of view. It makes sense to speak of an economic perspective, a political perspective, a historical perspective, or a sociological perspective. It makes no sense to speak of a criminological, a criminal justice, or a criminal perspective (at least not in an academic context). In my mind, the best criminology is done by those with a firm grounding in some discipline, or by those with an appreciation of several different disciplines, the insights of which are then brought to bear on criminological issues."

The chapter then proceeds to introduce several lessons that Charles learned throughout his illustrious career, which he later summarized as follows (pp.40-41):

1. Criminology is not a discipline but a topical area dependent on a variety of disciplines and that criminological knowledge is best pursued and dispensed within the context of a liberal arts education 
2. Our methods of identifying and recruiting new scholars must be improved
3. Evidence concerning most important issues having to do with crime and crime-relevant phenomena is weak; success requires that we commit ourselves to a long-range mission of improving that situation
4. Things are more complicated than our extant theories show, calling for improved theories specifying contingent and interactive effects
5. The most effective criminology demands that we be aware of and committed to the goal of developing general explanatory schemes refined through test and feedback
6. Science is the best model to follow in developing criminological knowledge
7. Weak science, which is likely to continue to characterize criminology for some time, is hardly a basis for policy
8. The barriers to, and distractions from, good scientific criminology, especially the widespread practice of ad hoc work and the intrusion of personal biases and larger ideologies, must be countered
9. Civility within the scholarly community is necessary for maximum collective effort

Our site's mission is to help answer his call by contributing modestly to the advancement of scientific criminology. In our own academic careers and scholarly pursuits, we have spent much time and effort on trying to understand philosophies of science, substantive theories of crime and deviance, and scientific methods and quantitative analytic techniques used to test social scientific theories. Our hope is that we will be able to effectively draw from these experiences to stimulate and enrich conversations in our field about how we might collectively strengthen our science through concerted efforts to improve our scientific explanations and the methods we use to generate knowledge about them. 

Need to say something about ourselves, why we created the site, and note the inspiration from Charles. We also probably want a caveat, similar to the preface of his book (he notes that the people he thanks are not responsible for the book's faults), that while inspired by him he in no way endorsed the project (and likely would have thought it was a waste of time).
