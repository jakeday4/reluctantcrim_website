## about the reluctant criminologists
:::

Welcome to our site! We are [Jon Brauer](https://www.jonbrauer.com) and [Jake Day](https://www.jacobcday.com/), aka the "reluctant criminologists." 

We created this site to publicly share course materials and musings about scientific theory and methods. We benefit immensely from the contributions in blogs and bookdown projects that so many others freely share for the collective good. Likewise, we envision this site as a public repository of sorts in our field of criminology and criminal justice dedicated to freely sharing resources that help us collectively strengthen our science. 

In particular, we provide course materials containing crime-relevant examples to help interested scholars in our field learn to use R and to improve the reproducibility of their workflows. Additionally, we will post occassional blog entries about topics in our areas of interest, including philosophy of science, criminology theory, and statistical techniques (e.g., ordinal modeling; Bayesian estimation; data visualization). We are also open to the idea of collaborating with or posting others' course materials and topical blog posts, so feel free to contact us with your ideas.

With respect to philosophy of science and criminology theory, we were both heavily influenced by the late [Dr. Charles R. Tittle](https://soc.wsu.edu/socnews/remembering-charles-tittle-1938-2021/). You can read more about how he directly inspired our site's name ("Reluctant Criminologists") in our [welcome blog](blog-posts/[1]/welcome-blog.html). If you are curious about Charles' philosophy of science, check out our blog on [his contributions to criminology](blog-posts/[2]/charles-memorial.html) and, specifically, my section on Charles as an *Advocate for Theoretical Science in Criminology*. However, we wish to make it clear that although we were inspired him, Charles in no way endorsed the project, and he likely would have thought it was a waste of time better spent contributing (in more traditional ways) to scientific theory development and testing.

In sharing course content and posts containing R code, we are committing to the practice of [coding in public](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz/status/1487921572509851649). Likewise, we expect to learn more than we teach through readers' constructive feedback on our innumerable coding inefficiencies and inevitable errors. So, please do reach out with suggestions or corrections. 

Finally, if we contribute anything of value on this site, undoubtedly someone else -  one or more of our many countless scientific heroes that tirelessly publish through traditional scientific outlets or share via their own blogs, bookdowns, and videos - deserve the lion's share of credit for it. To borrow from Charles Tittle (and specifically his preface to [*Control Balance*](https://www.routledge.com/Control-Balance-Toward-A-General-Theory-Of-Deviance/Tittle/p/book/9780813326320)), none of these people contributed to the errors or other shortcomings found in any materials that we post on this site.
