## About the Reluctant Criminologists

Need to say something about ourselves, why we created the site, and note the inspiration from Charles. We also probably want a caveat, similar to the preface of his book (he notes that the people he thanks are not responsible for the book's faults), that while inspired by him he in no way endorsed the project (and likely would have thought it was a waste of time).
