<p>We have learned so much from blogs, bookdowns, and videos openly shared by others. Here, we compiled a list of some of our favorite resources.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This list is far from exhaustive; there are too many influential sources to recall and credit as deserved. Nonetheless, we felt it would be helpful to pull together some of those that we routinely find ourselves revisiting and recommending to others.</p>
<section id="statistics-especially-bayesian-approaches-and-more" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistics-especially-bayesian-approaches-and-more">statistics, especially Bayesian approaches, and more</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Gelman’s</strong> <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/">blog</a> is perhaps our favorite place to go for musings on all things statistics, especially <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/08/10/bayesian-inference-continues-to-completely-solve-the-multiple-comparisons-problem/">Bayesian inference</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/12/02/not-frequentist-enough-2/">frequentist evaluation</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/03/11/regression-discontinuity-analysis-is-often-a-disaster-so-what-should-you-do-instead-do-we-just-give-up-on-the-whole-natural-experiment-idea-heres-my-recommendation/">causal inference</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/03/09/the-butterfly-and-the-piranha-understanding-the-generalizability-and-reproducibility-crisis-from-statistical-and-political-perspectives-my-talk-at-the-university-of-minnesota-political-science/">multilevel modeling</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/04/05/confidence-intervals-compatability-intervals-uncertainty-intervals/">uncertainty</a>, and <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/12/04/bayes-statistics-reproducibility-many-serious-problems-statistics-practice-arise-bayesian-inference-not-bayesian-enough-frequentist-evaluation-not-frequentist/">reproducibility</a>. We also appreciate the frequent attention paid to <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/11/exchange-with-deborah-mayo-on-abandoning-statistical-significance/">philosophy of science issues</a> throughout many posts. Bonus: if you browse long enough, you might even stumble upon an answer to the question that perennially motivates a career crisis for us: <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/03/12/the-social-sciences-are-useless-so-why-do-we-study-them-heres-a-good-reason/">The social sciences are useless, so why do we even study them?</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Andrew Gelman - do you want to <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/">learn regression</a> or <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/">Bayesian modeling</a>? Gelman and colleagues’ books and accompanying websites are excellent resources on these topics. However, our go-to resource for learning statistics from a Bayesian framework is <strong>Richard McElreath’s</strong> <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919"><em>Rethinking Statistics (2nd Ed.)</em></a>. All code from the book and a corresponding R package (<code>rethinking</code>) are <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">openly shared online</a>, and McElreath’s brilliant <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNUolPcpdclIg4Ijt4dqxVc">video lectures on YouTube</a>, which he routinely updates, simply are without equal. Seriously - stop reading our site now and go work your way through those lectures and associated code.</p>
<p>As much as we love McElreath’s book and lectures for learning a Bayesian approach to data analysis, we usually rely on <strong>Paul Bürkner’s</strong> “Bayesian regression models using Stan,” or <code>brms()</code>, <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/">R package</a> for everyday Bayesian modeling tasks. In addition to the <code>brms()</code> package, we recommend checking out Bürkner’s <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/projects/">research projects</a> and <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. In particular, we especially appreciate his work on modeling and visualizing <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/projects/#mu-bmb">uncertainty in (Bayesian) model comparison</a> and his efforts to incorporate cumulative link functions for modeling <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/9qkhj/">monotonic effects of ordinal predictors in Bayesian regression models</a>. Meanwhile, we are particularly fond of Bürkner’s <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/index.html"><code>brms</code> vignettes</a>, especially those on <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_multivariate.html">multivariate (i.e., multiple response variables) models</a> and <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_monotonic.html">monotonic effects</a>. You can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qeXD4NQ4To">his talk on multilevel modeling in <code>brms</code></a> for free courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@generableHQ/about"><span class="citation" data-cites="GenerableHQ">@GenerableHQ</span></a>.</p>
<p>So, what if you want to learn Bayesian analysis from McElreath’s book and lectures, yet you also want to follow along with his examples using the <code>brms()</code> package? Enter <strong>Solomon Kurz</strong>, the data science hero we need but do not deserve. Kurz has dedicated an unfathomable amount of energy to developing Bayesian translations of some of our favorite statistics books into R language and the <code>brms()</code> package, then sharing these valiant efforts in <a href="https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/book/">open-access bookdown projects</a>. Specifically, here are Kurz’s translations of the <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/3890">first edition</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/4857">second edition</a> of McElreath’s book. Additionally, many years agom Jake and I initially learned longitudinal data analysis in the SAS program using <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/41753">Singer and Willett’s (2003) now-classic book</a>; Kurz actually offers a free <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/4253/">tidyverse and brms translation</a> of their book as well! Likewise, he has similarly translated two other favorites of ours: <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/3686/">Kruschke’s <em>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</em></a> and Hayes’ <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/b472c7b3-ede5-40f0-9677-75c3704c7e5c/"><em>Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis</em></a>. If you make it through all that free content, then we suggest heading over to his informative <a href="https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/blog/">blog on data analysis in R</a> for more useful content.</p>
<p>There are so many others worth mentioning in this section but, in respect of your time, we will simply share the rest in list format:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matthew Kay’s</strong> <a href="https://www.mjskay.com/">site</a> for inspiration on communicating and visualizing uncertainty with <code>tidybayes</code> and <code>ggdist</code>. In particular, we recommend Kay’s various package vignettes, such as this one on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidybayes/vignettes/tidybayes.html">using tidy data with Bayesian models</a> and this one on <a href="https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/slabinterval.html">slab + interval stats and geoms with ggdist</a>. Also, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqCaljvE89k">Kay’s talk on visualizing uncertainty</a> courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@generableHQ/about"><span class="citation" data-cites="GenerableHQ">@GenerableHQ</span></a>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Andrew Heiss’s</strong> <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/">blog</a>, especially entries on <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/09/26/guide-visualizing-types-posteriors/">different types of posterior predictions</a>, <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/">marginal effects terminology</a>, and <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/11/29/conditional-marginal-marginaleffects/">conditional and marginal effects in multilevel models</a></li>
<li><strong>Aki Vehtari’s</strong> <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/">work</a>, especially that on <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/modelselection/">model selection</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544">model checking and cross-validation</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12335">posterior stacking</a>. Also, be sure to check out his various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcFy4yl5IyWeqJ5z2g1U8yg">videos</a>, like this one on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKRRyrPxxeU">Bayesian workflow</a> or his open access course videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBqnAso5Dy7O0IVoVn2b-WtetXQk5CDk6">Bayesian data analysis</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Betancourt’s</strong> <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/">writing</a> and <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/speaking/">videos</a> on probabilistic modeling in Stan, and especially those on adopting a <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html">principled Bayesian workflow</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.the100.ci/"><strong>The 100% CI</strong></a> is a newer favorite. We are especially fond of Julia Rohrer’s (one of the site’s authors) various writing related to causal inference, like these on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245917745629">directed acyclic graphs</a>, <a href="https://www.the100.ci/2017/03/14/that-one-weird-third-variable-problem-nobody-ever-mentions-conditioning-on-a-collider/">collider bias</a>, and what can go wrong with <a href="https://www.the100.ci/2023/03/07/non-representative-samples-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/">nonrepresentative samples</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Data Colada</strong> <a href="https://datacolada.org/">blog</a> offers great analysis on various topics. For instance, they write about <a href="https://datacolada.org/76">replication</a>, conduct <a href="https://datacolada.org/81">preregistered replications</a>, and even offer an R package (<a href="https://datacolada.org/100"><code>groundhog</code></a>) for improving reproducibililty of code. They also have interesting things to say about <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">meta-analysis</a> and problems with common techniques such as <a href="https://datacolada.org/58">funnel plots</a> and <a href="https://datacolada.org/30">trim and fill “corrections”</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dan Quintana,</strong> co-host of the <a href="https://everythinghertz.com/"><em>Everything Hertz</em> podcast</a>, also has a <a href="https://www.dsquintana.blog/">blog</a> containing great resources for meta-analysis and more in R.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Lakens’</strong> blog, the <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/">20% statistician</a>, is rife with useful posts about two of our favorite topics - statistics and philosophy of science. Some of our favorites include posts about <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2021/11/why-p-values-should-be-interpreted-as-p.html"><em>p</em>-values</a>, <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2020/03/effect-sizes-and-power-for-interactions.html">power</a> and <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html">observed power</a>, the <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2017/05/how-power-analysis-implicitly-reveals.html">smallest effect size of interest</a>, or whether <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/01/does-your-philosophy-of-science-matter.html">philosophy of science matters in practice</a> (we think it does a lot in criminology). Several of his lecture videos are also available online, including <a href="https://youtu.be/gVqFAQC8O14">this one</a> that corresponds to another favorite post discussing why more of us should seriously consider <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/11/do-you-really-want-to-test-hypothesis.html">whether we are really ready to test a hypothesis</a> in our research. Lakens has combined and expanded on a lot of these materials in his open access book, <a href="https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/index.html"><em>Improving Your Statistical Inferences</em></a> and his free <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences">coursera course</a> of the same name.<br>
</li>
<li>Of all the podcasts we enjoy, the <strong>Quantitude</strong> <a href="https://quantitudepod.org/?s=bayes">podcast</a> deserves a special shout-out for its highly informative yet quirky and accessible introduction to all sorts of important issues in statistics. Now, if only the hosts would join the Bayesian <a href="https://quantitudepod.org/s2e04-bayesian-wake-up-call/">dark side</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Jacob Kaplan</strong> has <a href="https://jacobdkaplan.weebly.com/books.html">multiple resources</a> related to R that are geared specifically to Criminologists. Perhaps most notably is a free online book <a href="https://crimebythenumbers.com/"><em>Crime by the Numbers: A Criminologist’s Guide to R</em></a>. Kaplan has great programming skills and, as such, many of his examples rely on base R functionality more so than ours do.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-data-science-with-r">learning data science with R</h2>
<p>While there is so much to learn from resources found at the links shared above, those are not the first places we send our students and friends that are interested in learning data science skills in R, yet that lack any R programming experience. We find the following links to be especially useful for these purposes - so much so that they deserve their own dedicated section! Of course, we also hope our <a href="../../course-materials">course materials</a> might be useful in this regard to some of you.</p>
<p><strong>Danielle Navarro’s</strong> <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/">blog</a> is as delightful as it is informative. The blog is a model for reproducible R programming and showcases Danielle’s inspiring art throughout the site (see more of Danielle’s <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/">computational art here</a>). The newest version of the blog often focuses on technical posts addressing issues beyond our range of program expertise. However, we love various topical essays from earlier blog renditions, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/wxn58/">like this one on preregistration</a>, and we strongly recommend Danielle’s <a href="https://robust-tools.djnavarro.net/">Data Science with R</a> course and associated video tutorials for R beginners or those interested in leveling up their R skills.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Hill’s</strong> <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/">blog</a> is a great place to find resources for learning to do as well as to teach R-related topics. For instance, we especially appreciate her post on teaching <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-05-how-i-teach-r-markdown/">R Markdown</a>, which was influential in creating our own courses, as well as her post on transitioning to <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/">Quarto</a>, which was helpful to us in creating our blog.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/">psyTeachR</a> website is a phenomenal repository of resources for learning and teaching reproducible research using R. They offer a wealth of open access courses and tutorials for undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://easystats.github.io/easystats/"><code>easystats</code></a> collection of R packages is a great place for those new to R to learn basic skills related to modeling, visualization, and reporting within a relatively unified framework. Those new Unlike curated nature of R and package conflicts Those transitioning from curated statistical packages to R’s open-source environment, with its <em>a la carte</em> format and associated challenges (e.g., package conflicts), may find the <code>easystats</code> suite of packages especially helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, we also love creating data visualizations with <code>ggplot2</code> in R, so we owe a huge shout out to <strong>Hadley Wickham</strong> for all his R programming efforts and clear tutorials and foundational texts, which you can learn more about and freely access via his <a href="https://hadley.nz/">website</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-a-website" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-website">creating a website</h2>
<p>If you want to learn to create your own website or blog using R, we recommend checking out Andrew Rapp’s <a href="https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html">ultimate guide to creating a Quarto blog</a>, Beatriz Mills’ guide to <a href="https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/">creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps</a>, Samantha Csik’s tutorial on <a href="https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/">adding a blog to your existing Quarto website</a>, and Ezekiel Ekunola’s instructions for <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@ekunolaeasybuoy/setting-up-domain-with-namecheap-netlify-12yiksvig6">setting up a personalized domain address for your site</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to R-based visualizations, we relied heavily upon <strong>Allison Horst’s</strong> <a href="https://allisonhorst.com/allison-horst">website</a>, where she freely shares amazing data science, statistics, and R themed artwork, to help improve our site’s aesthetics. We also had fun generating custom images and art using the artificial intelligence system <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a>.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p><em>Carter gave us permission to share the written notes for his comments delivered for the ASC tribute session:</em></p>
<p>Thank you Jon, and thank you for all of your organizing these sessions that allow us to reflect on Charles as such an important scholar and person for the field of criminology but also in our lives. My areas to cover are measurement and theory testing, and it was a wonderful idea to put those two together because when we look at Charles’s research in broad strokes, those two are inherently linked. I think of it in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charles was as theoretical as they come — he approached each issue with a deep concern for theory.</li>
<li>But he also was immensely empirical; analyzing data and testing hypotheses are the core of his research activities.</li>
<li>But a third thing: He commonly used data that he had some part in collecting, which meant that he wasn’t having to rely on the measures available in secondary data; instead, he played a role in shaping new novel measures of theoretical concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ultimately translated into extraordinary number of novel creative tests—studies that are among the best and most influential tests of a given theory, and this often was due in part to measurement.</p>
<p>And he did this for MANY different theories — by my count, it’s at 10 different theories not just that Charles was able to test, but that he was able to test with original data that enabled he and his co-authors to design their own measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differential association theory</li>
<li>Self-control theory</li>
<li>Deterrence theory</li>
<li>Reintegrative shaming and labeling theory</li>
<li>Strain theory, including general strain theory</li>
<li>Situational action theory</li>
<li>Colvin’s social support/coercion theory</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there also are theoretical topics that cut across <strong>multiple</strong> theories, including innovative work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>criminal motivations</li>
<li>morality and crime and religiosity and crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not possible talk about all of those areas where Charles had a big impact with respect to measurement and empirical testing. I’m instead going to discuss two of those areas—deterrence and self-control—in some detail as illustrations of his general approach and his lasting influence.</p>
</section>
<section id="deterrence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deterrence">Deterrence</h3>
<p>So the first area I want to focus on is deterrence. Charles’s work in this area most clearly begins with the Tittle (1969) article that used official data for the 50 states to reveal that the certainty of punishment—as indicated by the probability of imprisonment—was associated with lower crime and that severity (the length of prison sentences) also could reduce crime when certainty was at high levels. Charles’s key point in that article and in several others that followed in the 1970s was that deterrence needed to be taken seriously; it had been dismissed, but this wasn’t because good testing or good data had found problems; instead, he saw biases in play along with a tendency to go along with the conventional wisdom even when it wasn’t on firm ground.</p>
<p>Charles wasn’t in favor of deterrence theory, he wasn’t opposed to it—he wanted to test it effectively.</p>
<p>And his ideas on how best to test deterrence evolved fairly quickly and they would help shape the field. In 1972, Charles gets an NSF grant of $100,000 to fund a survey approach to testing deterrence theory. The results of that work were published in the book Sanctions and Social Deviance was published in 1980 and in some other articles published around that time.</p>
<p>Early in the book, he makes the case for studying deterrence with surveys, which of course, was quite different than his 1969 test that attracted so much attention—he expressed some real doubts that the macro-level research could ever explicitly reveal fear of sanctions as the operative mechanism, and this was crucial for distinguishing deterrence from other mechanisms by which punishment can affect crime.</p>
<p>Also, Charles felt that causal order issues would be tough to parse out because of how legal systems are embedded in complicated social contexts where history looms large. Even with sophisticated analyses, it was difficult to determine whether low certainty was leading to high crime, or conversely, whether high crime was leading to low certainty.</p>
<p>So he set out to try to address these two issues with a survey of roughly 2,000 adults randomly selected from three states: Iowa, Oregon, and New Jersey.</p>
<p>So on that first issue, Charles’s created an comprehensive measure of fear of sanctions. He identified multiple indicators of fear that were used for a multitude of different rule violations, with these capturing:</p>
<ul>
<li>the chances that people would find out?</li>
<li>would those be people you know?</li>
<li>would lots of people in the community find out?</li>
<li>would there be a loss of respect?</li>
<li>would it produce an arrest?</li>
<li>would produce jail?</li>
</ul>
<p>And then scores were further adjusted based on the person’s peer deviance—if most of the people that someone knew engaged in deviance, then them finding out probably shouldn’t be seen as increasing sanction fear.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll emphasize that Charles was not the only one pursuing this survey approach at this time (Waldo, Chiricos, Anderson), but his comprehensive approach to measurement was unique and his attention to scaling was meticulous.</p>
<ul>
<li>And let me mention something in connection to that — when you go to Charles’s CV, you see that 4 of his first 6 publications were explicitly measurement-oriented methodological pieces — measurement and scaling were the explicit priorities of the paper. This included articles or research notes from 1966-68 in American Journal of Sociology, Public Opinion Quarterly, Sociometry, and Social Forces. Collectively, they were cited more than 600 times and often re-printed.</li>
<li>These articles precede the articles in criminology that we think of regarding Charles’s career, and they dealt with things like political activity and bureaucratization, but there’s some foreshadowing that innovation and rigor in the area of measurement would be central to his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the scope of his survey-based approach to deterrence theory also was unique—it was a big project drawing a very diverse set of subjects from 3 states to ensure big variations in social contexts—which is critical to testing deterrence theory—a convenience sample taken from a group of people in the same social context simply isn’t the best test.</p>
<p>So that’s innovation #1 — taking the most rigorous approach possible to get at that mechanism of fear.</p>
<p>The second innovation dealt with this causal order issue, which had its own problems when using the survey approach. In cross-sectional studies, perceived certainty, severity, or fear of sanctions is measured at the time of the survey and offending is measured for the prior 6 or 12 months creating an obvious causal order concern in which offending precede perceptions of sanctions.</p>
<p>Now longitudinal panel data could be used but that’s difficult to come by and it creates the problem of lags—current perceptions are being used to predict future behavior, but what if perceptions of sanctions change and those current perceptions being measured at the time of the survey become outdated.</p>
<p>So Charles had an interesting fix for this — he measured projected deviance.</p>
<p>He asked this question: “If you were in a situation tomorrow where you had an extremely strong desire or need to [fill in the blank on the behavior], what are the chances that you would actually do it?”</p>
<p>So he used current perceptions of punishment to predict this measure of <strong>projected deviance</strong>, but he also measured prior deviance — it could be used as a conditioning variable or a control variable, and this measurement advance created much stronger causal inferences, especially in light of the later research that would show that projections of future deviance often were strongly correlated with actual deviance.</p>
<p>And this approach becomes the basis for many criminological studies that in some way make use of projected deviance or crime, intentions to offend, willingness to offend, and the vignette studies. These studies go beyond deterrence theory—studies on strain theory, differential association theory, self-control theory, and so on. In many instances, they cite Tittle’s earlier work—that’s especially true for the people in this room because there are a lot of us who have used these measures—but even when Tittle wasn’t cited, they typically lean on the same basic rational that Charles drew attention to more than 40 years ago:</p>
<p>the desire to use cross-sectional data to examine contemporaneous or short-term effects (rather than lagged effects) and to do so with stronger causal inferences.</p>
<p>Taking these two innovations together, what did Charles find? Findings that are very close to the current state of knowledge today. He found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanction fear reduces offending but fairly modestly.</li>
<li>Perceived informal sanctions tends to matter more than perceived formal sanctions.</li>
<li>And sanction fear generally has smaller effects than other theoretical variables, including moral commitments, social bonding, and differential associations.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Charles discovered lots of contingencies. His findings on this are immensely valuable; they laid the groundwork for interesting work to come on the idea of differential deterrability — with sanction fear operating more for some people and under some circumstances than others.</p>
<section id="sec-charles_deterrence" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-charles_deterrence">(Mark Stafford on deterrence)</h4>
<p>And this issue of contingencies is something that <a href="https://faculty.txst.edu/profile/1921048">Mark Stafford</a> emphasized in comments that he sent me. Mark had a family issue arise and he wasn’t able to travel to Chicago, but I wanted to share with you his comments on this issue:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Most deterrence researchers have paid lip-service to the idea that the threat of legal punishment probably interacts with other variables to affect the likelihood of crime. However, few have followed through on it, and no one as much as Charles. This was a central theme in his Sanctions and Social Deviance: The Question of Deterrence. A brief perusal of his deterrence studies over the years reveals that he looked at interactions between punishment threats and age, gender, informal punishments, self-control, and morality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Probably my favorite deterrence research by Charles focused on the possible interaction between punishment threats and motivation to commit crime. When I was a graduate student at the University of Arizona, I remember students (Mark Warr, Kirk Williams, Joe Rankin, and I) drinking with faculty (Jack Gibbs, Maynard Erickson, and Gary Jensen) on many occasions and discussing the obvious that punishment threats could not deter unless people were motivated to commit crime. We concluded, however, that motivation was too complex to capture in a simple measure. Move ahead decades later and that is exactly what Charles did – he measured motivation, and by simply asking people how much they wanted to commit crime. It turned out that this measure interacted with punishment threats to form a strong predictor of crime. Charles had a real talent of taking complex ideas and reducing them to their basics. What was too complex for the rest of us was easy for Charles. As a consequence, deterrence research is decades ahead of where it would have been without Charles. Perhaps it is hyperbole to compare Charles with Bentham and Beccaria, but I bet they would have liked to pick Charles’ brain about deterrence, and I bet Charles would tell them many things they got wrong.</p>

<section id="self-control-theorymany-innovations-here" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-control-theorymany-innovations-here">Self-control theory—many innovations here</h3>
<p>Let me pivot now to self-control theory, which is an area where Charles’s contributions are immense. Many of the things we know about this theory are things we learned from Charles’s work.</p>
<p>If you look at Charles’s book reviews and commentaries on Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory, along with comments he’d make, three things were clear: (1) he saw some shortcomings in the theory, (2) he was nevertheless impressed by the case they made for self-control being an important neglected variable, and (3) he knew the theory would attract a lot of attention and testing.</p>
<p>And a question has occurred to me, one that I wished I’d asked him: In 1991, when Charles published one of the first reviews of Gottfredson and Hirschi’s book, did he anticipate that he himself would become so central to the empirical testing of the theory? I don’t know; maybe some of you do.</p>
<p>But his centrality is unquestioned.</p>
<p>It begins obviously with the Grasmick et al.&nbsp;self-control scale, which of course never gets referred to by the more long-winded label of the Grasmick, Tittle, Bursik, and Arneklev scale. But I do know that Charles was quite involved in the development of that scale because he once described the painstaking process he went through to try to identify items from the California Psychological Inventory, along with the recognition at various points that newly invented items also would be needed.</p>
<p>That resulting scale they came up with was examined with new data from the Oklahoma City Survey in one the first tests of the theory, and that scale or subsets of it of it have been used in scores of studies. And their original study also has been cited more than 2600 times. The bottom line is that this scale is in many ways the gold standard for measuring self-control in criminology, and the meticulous attention to its scaling has inspired further research into not just this measure but possible limitations in Gottfredson and Hirschi’s initial conceptualization of self-control.</p>
<p>Another notable innovation of Charles’s in this area involves the distinction between <strong>self-control ability and self-control interest</strong>, along with his creative attempts to empirically distinguish them. This 2004 article with Grasmick and Ward really displays Charles’s skill in getting at the interplay between theoretical creativity and measurement. This study went beyond the arguments of the theory to consider something new, but rather than just making an interesting argument, he used data and creative measurement to test it.</p>
<p>The argument was this: self-control theory and research had been really centered on the idea that people differ in the <strong>ABILITY (or capacity)</strong> to exercise self-control—some people have that ability, some people don’t. Charles’s point was that there also could be variation in self-control <strong>INTEREST</strong>. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>some people may have a strong capacity for self-control but may not always want to exercise it, while others may have weak self-control ability but have such a keen interest in controlling their deviant impulses that they end up conforming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these two things—ability and interest—can both be consequential and maybe they even interact with each other. Maybe the effect that one has on crime depends on how much of the other they possess.</p>
<ul>
<li>And he also raises this interesting possibility: self-control <strong>interest</strong> could be distinct from ability in being especially responsive to social stimuli. Maybe self-control ability is pretty stable in the way that the theory predicts, but interest—do you feel like exercising the self-control you really do possess or do you not feel like it?—is probably a much more situationally-fluid variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in this study, using Oklahoma City Survey data, they construct a measure of self-control interest, and they do so with items that place a person in a situation in which they have the option of REFRAINING from some deviant action, and they ask might come from refraining—</p>
<ul>
<li>would it allow them to feel proud?</li>
<li>to earn praise from others?</li>
<li>to avoid losing the respect of people they care about?</li>
<li>to avoid feeling guilty?</li>
</ul>
<p>If they say yes to these things, that’s an <strong>interest</strong> in exercising self-control.</p>
<p>And very quickly on the findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>They found that items measuring self-control interest coalesced nicely, loading on the same factor and not loading on a 2nd factor that including the traditional self-control ABILITY items.</li>
<li>Self control interest and self-control ability BOTH affected offending, often similarly, but when differences did emerge, it was <strong>INTEREST</strong> having the greater effect</li>
<li>There was some evidence of interaction such that self-control ability mattered less when a person was really INTERESTED in exercising self-control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now there are other innovations that Charles had on self-control research, including measurement, but I’m running out of time. And there are other areas beyond deterrence and self-control theory that I would have liked to discuss. In particular, Charles’s research with Jon Brauer on Colvin’s social support and coercion theory in my mind provides a similar gold standard for testing that theory and measuring its concepts in both global and domain-specific ways.</p>
<p>But there’s not time, so I’ll just conclude by saying that the lasting influence of Charles’s research on theory testing and measurement comes back to a simple premise that seemed to always guide him, and we should be inspired to have it guide us as well. I believe that premise that really guided Charles was this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before reaching a conclusion on something, get the highest quality evidence you can, even if doing that is really hard. And it probably will be really hard. Press on and do it anyway.</li>
</ul>

<section id="introduction-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>As my colleagues have described, Charles’ scholarship advanced so many areas of criminological inquiry, including: (1) several important substantive debates in criminology; (2) concept measurement &amp; theory testing using survey research; (3) and assessment of the generality of criminological patterns &amp; theories across international contexts. As scholars, many of us would love to make meaningful contributions to any single issue within one of these broad areas. The breadth, magnitude, and consistency of his contributions cements Charles Tittle’s status as one of the brightest stars in our criminological universe.</p>
<p>Throughout all this work, one would be hard-pressed to find a theory of crime or deviance that was popular or that emerged during his illustrious 55+ year career that Charles had not read, reviewed, and even directly tested himself. Think about that a moment. He did not devote his time to becoming a specialist in any one theory or any particular area of inquiry. Rather, he devoted his time to becoming a specialist in countless theories and interdisciplinary areas relevant to his vast domain of inquiry – human behavior. That is, Charles embodied a generalist or Renaissance model of scholarship that seems all too rare in today’s knowledge silos, perpetuated by narrow training specializations, focused research funding and accomplishments, and exponential growth in short, quick-hitting publications.</p>
<p>Charles’ varied contributions stemmed directly from his philosophy of science. He was not simply jumping from latest fad to latest fad. He was not an opportunist doggedly seeking to aim his crosshairs at every emergent idea from other hard-working scholars. He was not just publishing because that is what we do. No, Charles had much loftier aims with his research and writing. Individually and in their totality, his publications reflect his deep commitment to the health and vibrancy of the field of criminology. In fact, to Charles, the health and vibrancy of a scientific field is tantamount to the health and vibrancy of <em>theoretical development</em> in that field.</p>
<p>Likewise, Charles devoted his entire career – and such a massive portion of his precious hours spent on this Earth – to trying to improve our theories: by reading them, thinking about them, testing them, critiquing them, developing them, and by advocating for and training others to do the same.</p>
</section>
<section id="charles-philosophy-the-mansion-of-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="charles-philosophy-the-mansion-of-science">Charles’ Philosophy &amp; The Mansion of Science</h3>
<p>Charles was not known as someone who spent much time writing explicitly about philosophy of science. Yet, he certainly had a coherent working scientific philosophy – his belief in and advocacy for the centrality of theories to scientific progress was a cornerstone – and while his scientific philosophy was readily apparent to those who knew him well, it also emanated from his teachings and writings.</p>
<p>In the introductory lecture to one of his foundational graduate theory courses, Charles would begin by describing the “mansion of science” as having many rooms, with these rooms divided into blocks representing different paradigms or models of science. After describing other complementary or competing models of science, such as descriptive, <em>vehrstehen</em>, engineering, critical, nihilistic approaches, and the like, Charles would then endorse the “theoretical science” model, which he viewed as the most efficient, reliable means of fostering scientific progress. He would also pointedly profess that the theoretical science model occupied the most rooms and held the best real estate in the mansion of science.</p>
<p>In this regard, Charles views were heavily influenced by works such as Richard Braithwaite’s classic 1953 book, <em>Scientific Explanation</em>, and by Paul Reynolds’ 1971 book, <em>A Primer in Theory Construction</em>. Reynolds’ book was particularly influential to Charles’ working scientific philosophy.</p>
<p>Like Reynolds, Charles viewed the goals of science and scientific activity as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>providing <em>typologies</em>, or identification and organization of phenomena into conceptual categories of similar and different things;</li>
<li>permitting the accurate <em>prediction</em> of future phenomena;</li>
<li>providing accurate <em>explanations</em> for past phenomena; and</li>
<li>providing people a <em>sense of understanding</em> about how and why phenomena occur via full articulation of the causal mechanisms linking changes in some concepts (causes) with changes in other concepts (effects).</li>
</ol>
<p>(Many would add the <em>potential for control</em> of phenomena as a secondary consequence of accurate explanation and prediction, though Charles was infamously resistant to making the jump from <em>is</em>-based knowledge to <em>ought</em>-based control or policy prescriptions given the state of our evidence, to which I will return soon.)</p>
<p>If these indeed are the primary goals of scientific activity, then theory development is central to science. Theories provide our typologies, or our conceptual categories and shared language about phenomena. Theories are our explanations of phenomena, and we use them to generate and test predictions. Likewise, theories are our (variably) formalized answers to why and how things occur and, as such, they do, or they fail to, provide us with a sense of understanding about – or potential for effective control of – phenomena. So, for Charles, science goes as our theories go. Also, like Reynolds, Charles viewed scientific progress or the successful pursuit of these goals as occurring most efficiently through what is reminiscent of a Lakatosian process involving:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Observing, describing, &amp; making initial empirical generalizations about phenomena -&gt;</li>
<li>Developing initial hypotheses, or what Charles endearingly called “simple theories,” that explain some of those descriptive patterns or empirical generalizations -&gt;</li>
<li>Rigorous testing of these (often numerous, varied, &amp; competing) hypotheses or “simple theories” -&gt;</li>
<li>Slow accumulation of knowledge from these tests; identification of additional generalizations &amp; negative cases; and, ultimately, the development of new theories that better account for patterns observed in accumulated knowledge base through processes such as theoretical invention, elaboration, or integration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Charles most explicitly outlines his adherence to this philosophy in one of my favorite pieces of his – a chapter in Gilbert Geis &amp; Mary Dodge’s wonderful 2002 book, <em>Lessons of Criminology</em> (see p.32-3), entitled “Confessions of a Reluctant but Committed Criminologist.” In it, he describes the eventual development of adequate theories ultimately is what will permit “explanation, prediction, and sometimes control of criminal/deviant or other human behavior.” He warns, a la Lakatos, that “[t]he whole process, however, is long and tedious, with knowledge growing in a cumulative process. One study means nothing; collections of large numbers and varieties of progressively more refined studies are required.” (p.33).</p>
</section>
<section id="lessons-of-a-reluctant-but-committed-criminologist" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-of-a-reluctant-but-committed-criminologist">Lessons of a Reluctant but Committed Criminologist</h3>
<p>In that Reflections chapter, Charles also described the first four important lessons of his academic career, which crystallized during his time on the faculty at Washington State University. Those are that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Our body of verified scientific knowledge is exceptionally weak</li>
<li>[Theoretical] Science is the best model for criminological work</li>
<li>Bias is pervasive in social science, including criminology, &amp; is an archenemy of knowledge</li>
<li>Recommendations or guidelines from criminologists for social policy should be delayed until there is a strong scientific base of relevant knowledge</li>
</ol>
<p>Charles then states: “…to fully comprehend their import [of these four lessons] one must share certain definitions and orientations about the meaning of science.” That is, one must share a view of science as ideally involving the slow process of knowledge construction through careful observation, empirical generalization, explanation, testing, evolution of community consensus about the adequacy an explanation following accumulation of supporting and challenging test results, development of refined explanations under more general explanatory schemes or adequate theories, and rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Charles worked with intention according to these lessons. His strong dedication to theory development always involved frequent testing of others’ ideas; ultimately, these efforts also culminated in his magnum opus, <em>Control Balance: Toward a General Theory of Deviance</em>. His advocacy for theoretical science was readily apparent in his book, in his reactions to critics of the book, and in his later published refinements to control balance theory.</p>
</section>
<section id="culmination-in-his-magnum-opus-control-balance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="culmination-in-his-magnum-opus-control-balance">Culmination in His Magnum Opus, <em>Control Balance</em></h3>
<p>In the first sentence of his published reply in <em>Theoretical Criminology</em> to John Braithwaite’s review of <em>Control Balance</em>, Charles summarized the dual aims of his book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<em>Control Balance</em>… tries to do two things. One is to set forth a paradigm for theory building and the other is to present an exemplar to be used as a starting point for the application of that paradigm. An important theme contained within the paradigm is that theory must represent the collective efforts of the community of scholars. No specific theoretical effort should be owned by anybody, a specific formulation is always tentative, and theory cumulates and improves as many individuals add their ideas and the results of research to the enterprise…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paradigm he envisions here is a theoretical science of criminology oriented toward the collective, collaborative construction of causal process theories. The first half of <em>Control Balance</em> described this paradigm in detail. He started by illustrating both the utility and deficiencies inherent in existing “simple theories” of crime and deviance, thereby convincingly highlighting the need for a new paradigm such as his – and likely disaffecting at least as many readers as he convinced in the process. He then described core features of an adequate theory, calling for criminologists to work towards developing theories with sufficient <em>breadth</em>, <em>comprehensiveness</em>, <em>precision</em>, and <em>depth</em>. He subsequently argued that integration around central causal processes or mechanisms, as opposed to invention or elaboration, holds the greatest promise for collaborative efforts at effective theory development.</p>
<p>I am convinced our field would benefit from widely disseminating these initial chapters as a touchstone by which we judge our ideas and organize our efforts. In particular, I think we really need collective commitment to improving the <em>precision</em> of our causal predictions – to “identifying the conditions that influence exactly when and to what degree causal processes will unfold, the nature of the causal effects, the time interval between the proposed causes and expected effects” (or timing, magnitude, and functional form), and other contingencies that specify the scope or conditions under which the causal processes and predictions are expected to vary.</p>
<p>Additionally, Charles thought our best chance at accumulating a meaningful body of scientific knowledge in criminology was for us to build a community of like-minded scholars dedicated to the same cause. Toward this end, foreshadowing post-replication crisis movements, Charles put forth provocative suggestions for a more collaborative peer review system (in <em>The Criminologist</em>), and he advocated for changes to our incentive structures and training regimes to foster theoretical science pursuits. For instance, in his 2002 Reflections chapter, Charles stated (p.33):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“For science to operate and to produce the desired outcomes, it must be supported by a community of scholars dedicated to the scientific enterprise. This community of scholars must structure itself to reward those who follow its dictates and ignore those who do not, and it must socialize new members in the values and methods of science. Those values include dedication to: (1) knowledge gained through the scientific method, (2) objectivity, (3) the search for truth, (4) open discussion and sharing of information, and (5) skepticism and mutual criticism. Science, therefore, is not value free. It is absolutely committed to a value system – the values of science. Moreover, science is a jealous master, insisting that other values (ideology and personal commitments) be rejected or overcome, at least when attempting to do science.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles also insisted that, this being a difficult task, we scientists organize our community to check competing values by “insisting on review by demanding critics, rewarding those who work against their own personal interests and values, and granting prestige to those who most fully exhibit the ideals of science while stigmatizing those who betray the cause.” If we meet these ideals, Charles asserted that “science can lead to knowledge that is more reliable, satisfying, and useful than any other paradigm by which people seek to understand human behavior and social organization.” However, “practicing science is difficult, especially for those who study social phenomena.” So, “the best that we criminologists can do is to practice science to the fullest extent possible, recognizing that our work often falls short and being cautious in our claims.”</p>
</section>
<section id="back-to-the-mansion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-to-the-mansion">Back to the Mansion</h3>
<p>How did Charles think we criminologists are doing in this regard? Well, remember that mansion of science? I will refrain from elaborating on our self-derogatory conversations about which floors (or subfloors) our fields – sociology, criminology, &amp; criminal justice – took up in the mansion. What I will say, though, is that over their final several years attending ASC, Charles and his close friend Jim Short would frequently lament about the diminishing number of ASC panels devoted specifically to theory compared to the burgeoning number of panels representing work within those other paradigms. Moreover, in our last conversations, Charles expressed much pessimism about the health of criminology and the future of theoretical development in our field.</p>
<p>I certainly empathized with his viewpoint – much more so than I let him know in those conversations. However, I also pointed to various developments – such as emerging theoretical solutions to the replication crisis; advances in formal modeling; sophisticated theorizing and prediction in the Bayesian movement; and theoretical advancements tied to the counterfactual causal revolution – that I think hold much promise for interdisciplinary social science. He was also encouraged when I summarized Proctor &amp; Niemeyer’s new book, <em>Mechanistic Criminology</em>, which (I think) in many ways represents a new generation of criminologists carrying Charles’ paradigmatic torch into exciting unexplored theoretical territory and, likewise, holds much promise for our field.</p>
<p>Most importantly, across more than a half-century of scholarship, Charles practiced science to the fullest extent possible, he never failed to recognize that his work often fell short, and likewise he was consistently cautious in his claims. In doing so, he was perhaps most effective as a relentless advocate for theoretical science in criminology in leading us by example. His writings will live on in the scholarly record – with each of his individual studies meaning nothing on their own but, collectively, each contributing as “grist for the mill” of science in the long and tedious process of cumulative knowledge production. Additionally, likely without explicitly intending to do so, he built a community of like-minded scholars – including many of you in this room – who share his pursuit and, in doing so, make his journey and his immense sacrifices on the alter of science meaningful.</p>
</section>
<section id="community-building-by-example" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-building-by-example">Community Building by Example</h3>
<p>Finally, as a last testament to his advocacy and community building by example, I would like to close with quotes from a few students of Charles’ students – these are young scholars, a generation removed, most of whom never had the pleasure of meeting the man, the myth, the legend in black jeans and cowboy boots.</p>
<p>As these excerpts come from a list of longer quotes that I collected for a different purpose – to read to Charles as he neared the end – I have kept the authors’ names anonymous here. They are a small sample, but I think these effectively represent the legacy of influence that Charles Tittle has left with his students and colleagues.</p>
<p>First, two assistant professors who never met Charles but had read Control Balance in a graduate course state that reading Control Balance theory reminded them:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“of the creativity, effort, and time it takes to actually put forth a theory. Your review of previous criminological theories and their weaknesses to even set up Control Balance Theory shows how meticulous you were in theory building approach. In today’s race to publish, it is easy to lose sight of the difficulty and time it takes to develop a comprehensive framework for thinking about crime.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An advanced doctoral student states that “Dr.&nbsp;Charles Tittle was the first scholar who was able to convince me of the value and power of theory and” that reading <em>Control Balance</em> “was, in the deepest sense of the word, enlightening.” After reading it, this student says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I now think theory development and testing are some of the most important scientific endeavors social scientists can and should engage in–moreover, I find them the most intellectually satisfying! It turns out I love theory. His book, his articles, and even discussions with his former students influenced by his work have certainly shaped my trajectory as a student and a scholar. And I am certain that echoes of his influence will continue to shape the rest of my academic career.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An advanced graduate student states that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Control Balance had a tremendous influence on me… in illustrating and breaking down all the complexities that go into theory building and integration. We all know human behavior is a complicated phenomenon, but the way Control Balance looks at the integration of theories to build a general theory of crime and how it connects the numerous converging variables, which each exists on their own continuum, is just artistry. Dr.&nbsp;Tittle’s work really stuck with me in enumerating how much work we have ahead of us in our field (and in many other fields) to truly understanding the nature of crime and deviance. His call for the continued elaboration on his work really sets a precedence for how we as scholars should approach and encourage critiques, elaboration, and hopefully integration on our own work instead of falling into the time-old tradition of pure competition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A newer doctoral student says that prior to reading <em>Control Balance</em> for a course:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I had not, in fact, taken any interest in theory construction or debate, believing it to be outside of my level of comprehension. Upon reading Control Balance, I realized that theory is not a tool that one can afford to overlook out of fear of dissonance and ambiguity. As an individual who has only just begun to break into the world of theoretical science…, your book could not have come to me at a better time. For that, I thank you and proudly take up your call toward better theory, debate, and collaboration…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, an advanced doctoral student explains various lessons learned from Charles work:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…your [Reflections chapter] taught me that it is important to be nice in the work that we do (from your conversation with Dr.&nbsp;Short), that it is okay to do science for the sake of science, and not to be supremely concerned with policy relevance. Along similar lines, your article The Arrogance of Public Sociology taught me to employ healthy skepticism regarding research that is primarily public/policy driven. Additionally, your work on Control Balance Theory has helped me see where existing theories are deficient, how they can potentially be improved, and how complex it is to formulate a grand theory of deviant/criminal behavior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This student also reflected on how Charles’ legacy of mentorship was indirectly influential in teaching the importance of:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…increasing methodological rigor in research methodology/statistical analysis, creating a more transparent and cumulative science, being honest about things we do not know in the field, and an appreciation for the importance of testing and refining criminological theory. … I am forever grateful to you and cannot wait to pass on these principles to students of my own one day.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not have said that better myself. Thank you, Charles.</p>

<p>We have learned so much from blogs, bookdowns, and videos openly shared by others. Here, we compiled a list of some of our favorite resources.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This list is far from exhaustive; there are too many influential sources to recall and credit as deserved. Nonetheless, we felt it would be helpful to pull together some of those that we routinely find ourselves revisiting and recommending to others.</p>
<section id="statistics-especially-bayesian-approaches-and-more" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistics-especially-bayesian-approaches-and-more">statistics, especially Bayesian approaches, and more</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Gelman’s</strong> <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/">blog</a> is perhaps our favorite place to go for musings on all things statistics, especially <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/08/10/bayesian-inference-continues-to-completely-solve-the-multiple-comparisons-problem/">Bayesian inference</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/12/02/not-frequentist-enough-2/">frequentist evaluation</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/03/11/regression-discontinuity-analysis-is-often-a-disaster-so-what-should-you-do-instead-do-we-just-give-up-on-the-whole-natural-experiment-idea-heres-my-recommendation/">causal inference</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/03/09/the-butterfly-and-the-piranha-understanding-the-generalizability-and-reproducibility-crisis-from-statistical-and-political-perspectives-my-talk-at-the-university-of-minnesota-political-science/">multilevel modeling</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/04/05/confidence-intervals-compatability-intervals-uncertainty-intervals/">uncertainty</a>, and <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/12/04/bayes-statistics-reproducibility-many-serious-problems-statistics-practice-arise-bayesian-inference-not-bayesian-enough-frequentist-evaluation-not-frequentist/">reproducibility</a>. We also appreciate the frequent attention paid to <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/11/exchange-with-deborah-mayo-on-abandoning-statistical-significance/">philosophy of science issues</a> throughout many posts. Bonus: if you browse long enough, you might even stumble upon an answer to the question that perennially motivates a career crisis for us: <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/03/12/the-social-sciences-are-useless-so-why-do-we-study-them-heres-a-good-reason/">The social sciences are useless, so why do we even study them?</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Andrew Gelman - do you want to <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/">learn regression</a> or <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/">Bayesian modeling</a>? Gelman and colleagues’ books and accompanying websites are excellent resources on these topics. However, our go-to resource for learning statistics from a Bayesian framework is <strong>Richard McElreath’s</strong> <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919"><em>Rethinking Statistics (2nd Ed.)</em></a>. All code from the book and a corresponding R package (<code>rethinking</code>) are <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">openly shared online</a>, and McElreath’s brilliant <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNUolPcpdclIg4Ijt4dqxVc">video lectures on YouTube</a>, which he routinely updates, simply are without equal. Seriously - stop reading our site now and go work your way through those lectures and associated code.</p>
<p>As much as we love McElreath’s book and lectures for learning a Bayesian approach to data analysis, we usually rely on <strong>Paul Bürkner’s</strong> “Bayesian regression models using Stan,” or <code>brms()</code>, <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/">R package</a> for everyday Bayesian modeling tasks. In addition to the <code>brms()</code> package, we recommend checking out Bürkner’s <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/projects/">research projects</a> and <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. In particular, we especially appreciate his work on modeling and visualizing <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/projects/#mu-bmb">uncertainty in (Bayesian) model comparison</a> and his efforts to incorporate cumulative link functions for modeling <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/9qkhj/">monotonic effects of ordinal predictors in Bayesian regression models</a>. Meanwhile, we are particularly fond of Bürkner’s <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/index.html"><code>brms</code> vignettes</a>, especially those on <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_multivariate.html">multivariate (i.e., multiple response variables) models</a> and <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_monotonic.html">monotonic effects</a>. You can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qeXD4NQ4To">his talk on multilevel modeling in <code>brms</code></a> for free courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@generableHQ/about"><span class="citation" data-cites="GenerableHQ">@GenerableHQ</span></a>.</p>
<p>So, what if you want to learn Bayesian analysis from McElreath’s book and lectures, yet you also want to follow along with his examples using the <code>brms()</code> package? Enter <strong>Solomon Kurz</strong>, the data science hero we need but do not deserve. Kurz has dedicated an unfathomable amount of energy to developing Bayesian translations of some of our favorite statistics books into R language and the <code>brms()</code> package, then sharing these valiant efforts in <a href="https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/book/">open-access bookdown projects</a>. Specifically, here are Kurz’s translations of the <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/3890">first edition</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/4857">second edition</a> of McElreath’s book. Additionally, many years agom Jake and I initially learned longitudinal data analysis in the SAS program using <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/41753">Singer and Willett’s (2003) now-classic book</a>; Kurz actually offers a free <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/4253/">tidyverse and brms translation</a> of their book as well! Likewise, he has similarly translated two other favorites of ours: <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/3686/">Kruschke’s <em>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</em></a> and Hayes’ <a href="https://bookdown.org/content/b472c7b3-ede5-40f0-9677-75c3704c7e5c/"><em>Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis</em></a>. If you make it through all that free content, then we suggest heading over to his informative <a href="https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/blog/">blog on data analysis in R</a> for more useful content.</p>
<p>There are so many others worth mentioning in this section but, in respect of your time, we will simply share the rest in list format:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matthew Kay’s</strong> <a href="https://www.mjskay.com/">site</a> for inspiration on communicating and visualizing uncertainty with <code>tidybayes</code> and <code>ggdist</code>. In particular, we recommend Kay’s various package vignettes, such as this one on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidybayes/vignettes/tidybayes.html">using tidy data with Bayesian models</a> and this one on <a href="https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/slabinterval.html">slab + interval stats and geoms with ggdist</a>. Also, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqCaljvE89k">Kay’s talk on visualizing uncertainty</a> courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@generableHQ/about"><span class="citation" data-cites="GenerableHQ">@GenerableHQ</span></a>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Andrew Heiss’s</strong> <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/">blog</a>, especially entries on <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/09/26/guide-visualizing-types-posteriors/">different types of posterior predictions</a>, <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/">marginal effects terminology</a>, and <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/11/29/conditional-marginal-marginaleffects/">conditional and marginal effects in multilevel models</a></li>
<li><strong>Aki Vehtari’s</strong> <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/">work</a>, especially that on <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/modelselection/">model selection</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544">model checking and cross-validation</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12335">posterior stacking</a>. Also, be sure to check out his various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcFy4yl5IyWeqJ5z2g1U8yg">videos</a>, like this one on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKRRyrPxxeU">Bayesian workflow</a> or his open access course videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBqnAso5Dy7O0IVoVn2b-WtetXQk5CDk6">Bayesian data analysis</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Betancourt’s</strong> <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/">writing</a> and <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/speaking/">videos</a> on probabilistic modeling in Stan, and especially those on adopting a <a href="https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html">principled Bayesian workflow</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.the100.ci/"><strong>The 100% CI</strong></a> is a newer favorite. We are especially fond of Julia Rohrer’s (one of the site’s authors) various writing related to causal inference, like these on <a href="ADD">directed acyclic graphs</a>, <a href="ADD">collider bias</a>, and what can go wrong with <a href="https://www.the100.ci/2023/03/07/non-representative-samples-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/">nonrepresentative samples</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Data Colada</strong> <a href="https://datacolada.org/">blog</a> offers great analysis on various topics. For instance, they write about <a href="https://datacolada.org/76">replication</a>, conduct <a href="https://datacolada.org/81">preregistered replications</a>, and even offer an R package (<a href="https://datacolada.org/100"><code>groundhog</code></a>) for improving reproducibililty of code. They also have interesting things to say about <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">meta-analysis</a> and problems with common techniques such as <a href="https://datacolada.org/58">funnel plots</a> and <a href="https://datacolada.org/30">trim and fill “corrections”</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dan Quintana,</strong> co-host of the <a href="https://everythinghertz.com/"><em>Everything Hertz</em> podcast</a>, also has a <a href="https://www.dsquintana.blog/">blog</a> containing great resources for meta-analysis and more in R.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Lakens’</strong> blog, the <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/">20% statistician</a>, is rife with useful posts about two of our favorite topics - statistics and philosophy of science. Some of our favorites include posts about <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2021/11/why-p-values-should-be-interpreted-as-p.html"><em>p</em>-values</a>, <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2020/03/effect-sizes-and-power-for-interactions.html">power</a> and <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html">observed power</a>, the <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2017/05/how-power-analysis-implicitly-reveals.html">smallest effect size of interest</a>, or whether <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/01/does-your-philosophy-of-science-matter.html">philosophy of science matters in practice</a> (we think it does a lot in criminology). Several of his lecture videos are also available online, including <a href="https://youtu.be/gVqFAQC8O14">this one</a> that corresponds to another favorite post discussing why more of us should seriously consider <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/11/do-you-really-want-to-test-hypothesis.html">whether we are really ready to test a hypothesis</a> in our research. Lakens has combined and expanded on a lot of these materials in his open access book, <a href="https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/index.html"><em>Improving Your Statistical Inferences</em></a> and his free <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences">coursera course</a> of the same name.<br>
</li>
<li>Of all the podcasts we enjoy, the <strong>Quantitude</strong> <a href="https://quantitudepod.org/?s=bayes">podcast</a> deserves a special shout-out for its highly informative yet quirky and accessible introduction to all sorts of important issues in statistics. Now, if only the hosts would join the Bayesian <a href="https://quantitudepod.org/s2e04-bayesian-wake-up-call/">dark side</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Jacob Kaplan</strong> has <a href="https://jacobdkaplan.weebly.com/books.html">multiple resources</a> related to R that are geared specifically to Criminologists. Perhaps most notably is a free online book <a href="https://crimebythenumbers.com/"><em>Crime by the Numbers: A Criminologist’s Guide to R</em></a>. Kaplan has great programming skills and, as such, many of his examples rely on base R functionality more so than ours do.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-data-science-with-r">learning data science with R</h2>
<p>While there is so much to learn from resources found at the links shared above, those are not the first places we send our students and friends that are interested in learning data science skills in R, yet that lack any R programming experience. We find the following links to be especially useful for these purposes - so much so that they deserve their own dedicated section! Of course, we also hope our <a href="../../course-materials">course materials</a> might be useful in this regard to some of you.</p>
<p><strong>Danielle Navarro’s</strong> <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/">blog</a> is as delightful as it is informative. The blog is a model for reproducible R programming and showcases Danielle’s inspiring art throughout the site (see more of Danielle’s <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/">computational art here</a>). The newest version of the blog often focuses on technical posts addressing issues beyond our range of program expertise. However, we love various topical essays from earlier blog renditions, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/wxn58/">like this one on preregistration</a>, and we strongly recommend Danielle’s <a href="https://robust-tools.djnavarro.net/">Data Science with R</a> course and associated video tutorials for R beginners or those interested in leveling up their R skills.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Hill’s</strong> <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/">blog</a> is a great place to find resources for learning to do as well as to teach R-related topics. For instance, we especially appreciate her post on teaching <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-05-how-i-teach-r-markdown/">R Markdown</a>, which was influential in creating our own courses, as well as her post on transitioning to <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/">Quarto</a>, which was helpful to us in creating our blog.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/">psyTeachR</a> website is a phenomenal repository of resources for learning and teaching reproducible research using R. They offer a wealth of open access courses and tutorials for undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://easystats.github.io/easystats/"><code>easystats</code></a> collection of R packages is a great place for those new to R to learn basic skills related to modeling, visualization, and reporting within a relatively unified framework. Those new Unlike curated nature of R and package conflicts Those transitioning from curated statistical packages to R’s open-source environment, with its <em>a la carte</em> format and associated challenges (e.g., package conflicts), may find the <code>easystats</code> suite of packages especially helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, we also love creating data visualizations with <code>ggplot2</code> in R, so we owe a huge shout out to <strong>Hadley Wickham</strong> for all his R programming efforts and clear tutorials and foundational texts, which you can learn more about and freely access via his <a href="https://hadley.nz/">website</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-a-website" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-website">creating a website</h2>
<p>If you want to learn to create your own website or blog using R, we recommend checking out Andrew Rapp’s <a href="https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html">ultimate guide to creating a Quarto blog</a>, Beatriz Mills’ guide to <a href="https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/">creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps</a>, Samantha Csik’s tutorial on <a href="https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/">adding a blog to your existing Quarto website</a>, and Ezekiel Ekunola’s instructions for <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@ekunolaeasybuoy/setting-up-domain-with-namecheap-netlify-12yiksvig6">setting up a personalized domain address for your site</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to R-based visualizations, we relied heavily upon <strong>Allison Horst’s</strong> <a href="https://allisonhorst.com/allison-horst">website</a>, where she freely shares amazing data science, statistics, and R themed artwork, to help improve our site’s aesthetics. We also had fun generating custom images and art using the artificial intelligence system <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a>.</p>

<section id="why-are-we-doing-this" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-we-doing-this">Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>First, this site is intended primarily as a central repository for conveniently sharing our course material and preliminary ideas with students and colleagues. It allows us to simply point people to a website rather than sending large html files via email or proliferating dropbox links. If it serves only this purpose effectively, we will be happy.</p>
<p>Second, this site is a direct consequence of our recent efforts to re-tool our approaches to doing science. We think this site will serve as evidence for how much we have learned - and likely as even stronger evidence of how much more we have yet to learn.</p>
<p>Of course, this begs the question: Why have we been re-tooling our approaches to science? Well, answering that question requires a longer conversation with multiple threads, and we anticipate weaving some of those threads into our future blog posts. For now, it may be clear from our posted materials that we are motivated to act in response to increasing concerns about replication failures across multiple scientific disciplines and awareness of subsequent reforms. We are also motivated by the perception that our academic disciplines of sociology and criminology, with some exceptions, may be lagging behind other fields <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/09/22/why-is-the-scientific-replication-crisis-centered-on-psychology/">like psychology</a> in self-reflection on these important issues and widespread adoption of <a href="https://www.economicscience.org/downloads/ReplicationWhitePaper.pdf">potentially effective reforms</a>. Likewise, we are moved by own experiences with reproducing <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124119826158">high-profile work</a> and attempting to raise awareness through the traditional academic peer-review publication process about concerns regarding underpowered null hypothesis significance tests and and common misinterpretations of null findings from such tests.</p>
<p>It is also fair to say that this site is indicative of early-mid-career crises of sorts brought on by other factors such as post-tenure malaise and serious reflections about what we are doing with our limited time in the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In fact, the initial idea for the blog emerged during the height of the pandemic in a long email thread between Jon and Jake. In a somewhat typical exchange, Jake was asking Jon to explain a relatively complex statistical topic (e.g., latent variable modeling in SEM vs.&nbsp;multilevel modeling). Jon was sharing resources, summarizing debates, and explaining issues that have been published on the topic across disparate statistical literatures over the years. Jake thought putting these types of discussions into a blog might be beneficial for multiple reasons. First, rather than burying this writing in emails, others might also appreciate such reviews or tutorials if they were available in a free, public-facing blog. Second, Jon seemed reluctant to write traditional academic articles on such topics since, from his perspective, they would be redundant - the reviews and debates are already out there, you just need to go read them (often in other fields). Meanwhile, Jon was receptive to the idea of a blog; he thought Jake should write more, and a blog might be a good way for both of them to spill ink and “try out” ideas under a critical public eye while perhaps even helping some students and colleagues along the way. So, here we are.</p>

<section id="how-we-were-inspired-by-charles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-we-were-inspired-by-charles">How we were inspired by Charles</h2>
<p>The name of our site pays homage to our late mentor and friend, Dr.&nbsp;Charles R. Tittle. It is meant to be a cheeky reference to his chapter entitled “Reflections of a Reluctant but Committed Criminologist” in Gilbert Geis and Mary Dodge’s <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781315721507/lessons-criminology-gilbert-geis-mary-dodge"><em>Lessons of Criminology</em></a> (pp.23-45).</p>
<p>This is one of our favorite pieces written by Charles. Our perspectives on the field of criminology and criminal justice were heavily shaped by Charles and are thus quite comparable to the views he presents in that chapter. Here is how that chapter starts (p.23):</p>
<!-- Why not just use block quote? -->

<p>“I didn’t intend to become a criminologist. Rather, happenstance led me to investigate certain sociological problems that resulted in my being labeled a criminologist (Tittle, 1991). After a while the reactions of others had the effects that symbolic interactionist theory would predict - I began to think of myself as a criminologist, although one with a larger allegiance. In fact, one of the first conclusions I drew as a criminologist is that criminology ought not be thought of as a discipline. Disciplines have unifying perspectives; criminology does not. Criminology is an umbrella term encompassing diverse studies of crime and crime-relevant phenomena undertaken from many disciplinary points of view. It makes sense to speak of an economic perspective, a political perspective, a historical perspective, or a sociological perspective. It makes no sense to speak of a criminological, a criminal justice, or a criminal perspective (at least not in an academic context). In my mind, the best criminology is done by those with a firm grounding in some discipline, or by those with an appreciation of several different disciplines, the insights of which are then brought to bear on criminological issues.”</p>

<p>The chapter then proceeds to introduce several lessons that Charles learned throughout his illustrious career, which he later summarized as follows (pp.40-41):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol type="1">
<li>Criminology is not a discipline but a topical area dependent on a variety of disciplines and that criminological knowledge is best pursued and dispensed within the context of a liberal arts education</li>
<li>Our methods of identifying and recruiting new scholars must be improved</li>
<li>Evidence concerning most important issues having to do with crime and crime-relevant phenomena is weak; success requires that we commit ourselves to a long-range mission of improving that situation</li>
<li>Things are more complicated than our extant theories show, calling for improved theories specifying contingent and interactive effects</li>
<li>The most effective criminology demands that we be aware of and committed to the goal of developing general explanatory schemes refined through test and feedback</li>
<li>Science is the best model to follow in developing criminological knowledge</li>
<li>Weak science, which is likely to continue to characterize criminology for some time, is hardly a basis for policy</li>
<li>The barriers to, and distractions from, good scientific criminology, especially the widespread practice of ad hoc work and the intrusion of personal biases and larger ideologies, must be countered</li>
<li>Civility within the scholarly community is necessary for maximum collective effort</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are interested in learning more about some of Charles Tittle’s intellectual contributions, check out <a href="../../blog-posts/[3]/charles-memorial.html">our blog post on the topic</a>, which contains comments delivered in a tribute panel for Charles at the 2021 American Society of Criminology annual meetings. To be clear, as we also note on our <a href="../../about.html"><em>About</em> page</a>, we were inspired by Charles but he did not endorse this project in any way; in fact, he likely would have thought it was a waste of time better spent contributing in more traditional ways to scientific theory development and testing. We think it’s safe to say that we are both more “reluctant” and less “committed” criminologists than Charles was.</p>

<p>If we have a loftier aim for our site, it is to answer the call expressed in Charles’ lessons above by contributing modestly to the advancement of scientific criminology. In other words, this site is an attempt to help improve upon, even if just a little, what we perceive are systematic shortcomings in our respective fields.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not alone - scholars raise similar concerns in other social scientific disciplines, including <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.1990.66.1.195">psychology</a>, <a href="https://openmkt.org/blog/2022/replications-in-marketing-myth-and-reality/">marketing</a>, and <a href="https://elevanth.org/blog/2022/09/19/the-problem-with-cultural-evolution/">evolutionary anthropology</a> to name a few. Likewise, we benefit immensely from the contributions in blogs and bookdown projects shared freely for the collective good by so many people from various disciplinary perspectives working within and outside academia. We encourage you to check out our <a href="../../blog-posts/[2]/favorite_links.html">favorite links</a> post for some excellent examples. Our hope is that this site might offer a comparable (derivative, bargain-basement) version that enriches conversations in our fields about how we can collectively strengthen our science through concerted efforts to improve our theories and the methods we use to generate knowledge about them.</p>
<p>In our own academic careers and scholarly pursuits, we continually try to improve our understanding of philosophies of science, substantive theories of crime and deviance, and quantitative methods used to test social scientific theories. Rather than solely bothering seemingly uninterested authors about these issues in the reviews we write for journals (we both now sign our reviews but the editors often take our names off), we thought we might as well put our thoughts out in public and subject them to criticism. Of course, we recognize the most likely outcome is that our thoughts, like in many of the reviews we write, will simply be (justifiably?) ignored. But we expect our own thinking on these matters will be strengthened by forcing ourselves to write them down and, ideally, by then accounting for your feedback.</p>
<p>So welcome to our blog! We’ll try to keep the navel gazing to a minimum from here on out.</p>
