    "text": "My job is to introduce a little tension into an otherwise harmonious system.\n— Charles Tittle in “The Arrogance of Public Sociology”\nWelcome to our site! We are Jon Brauer and Jake Day, aka the “Reluctant Criminologists.”\nWe created this site to publicly share course materials and musings about scientific theory and methods. We benefit immensely from the contributions in blogs and bookdown projects that so many others freely share for the collective good. Likewise, we envision this site as a public repository of sorts in our field of criminology and criminal justice dedicated to freely sharing resources that help us collectively strengthen our science.\nIn particular, we provide course materials containing crime-relevant examples to help interested scholars in our field learn to use R and to improve the reproducibility of their workflows. Additionally, we will post occassional blog entries about topics in our areas of interest, including philosophies of science, criminology theory, and statistical techniques (e.g., ordinal modeling; Bayesian estimation; data visualization). We are also open to the idea of collaborating with or posting others’ course materials and topical blog posts, so feel free to contact us with your ideas.\nIn sharing this content, we are committing to the practice of coding in public. Likewise, we expect to learn more than we teach through readers’ constructive feedback on our innumerable coding inefficiencies and inevitable errors. So, please do reach out with suggestions or corrections.\nThe chapter then proceeds to introduce several lessons that Charles learned throughout his illustrious career, which he later summarized as follows (pp.40-41):\nOur site’s mission is to help answer Charles’ call by contributing modestly to the advancement of scientific criminology. In our own academic careers and scholarly pursuits, we have devoted much effort to understanding philosophies of science, substantive theories of crime and deviance, and quantitative methods used to test social scientific theories. Our hope is that we will be able to effectively draw from these experiences to enrich conversations in our field about how we might collectively strengthen our science through concerted efforts to improve our scientific theories and the methods we use to generate knowledge about them.\nIf you are interested in learning more about some of Charles Tittle’s intellectual contributions, visit our blog post containing comments delivered in a memorial panel for Charles at the November 2021 American Society of Criminology annual meetings. To be clear, while inspired by him, Charles in no way endorsed the project (and he likely would have thought it was a waste of time).\nFinally, if we contribute anything of value on this site, undoubtedly someone else - one or more of our many countless scientific heroes that tirelessly publish through traditional scientific outlets or share via their own blogs, bookdowns, and videos - deserve the lion’s share of credit for it. Yet, to borrow again from Charles (preface to his Control Balance), none of these people contributed to the errors or other shortcomings found in any materials that we post on this site."

    "text": "In the fall of 2021, Jon was on the schedule to teach a new course titled “Replication & Reproducibility in Social Science” as a substitute for IU Criminal Justice Department’s typical graduate “Methods” degree requirement. The same semester, Jake was scheduled to teach the “Social Research Methods” course to first-year MA students in UNCW’s Department of Sociology and Criminology. He decided to join Jon in revising the class to focus on replication and reproducibility. The result was a jointly designed course focusing on replication and reproducibility issues broadly across the social sciences, but with specific examples from sociology and criminology. You can take a look at both Jon’s syllabus and Jake’s syllabus for the course. They are basically identical, but Jon’s syllabus includes a complete reference list for the assigned and recommended readings. Also, because of a weird scheduling quirk, Jake had to combine two weeks into one (Hype and Perverse Incentives).\nIn addition to teaching them about replication and reproducibility issues more generally, we also wanted to help them learn some practical skills to help them produce more reliable and transparent research. To do this, we had them complete two sets of assignments: 1) R Assignments intended to provide a basic introduction to conducting reproducible research using the R Statistical Computing Environment and RStudio and 2) a Reproducibility Project where they had the reproduce the (descriptive) results of a published article on a topic of interest to them. The “R Assignments” ended up being a basic introduction to data wrangling, data visualization and reporting, and reproducible workflow with a primary emphasis on the Tidyverse suite of packages. The “Reproducibility Project” was an opportunity for students to apply these new skills to a topic that interested them, get their hands dirty with real-world data, and develop an appreciated of the difficulties involved in computationally reproducing published work when you do not have access to the code used to clean, wrangle and analyze the data.\nWe have included these assignments as they were assigned in Jon’s class with light editing, where necessary, for student privacy reasons. In a forthcoming blog post we will discuss what we learned from designing this course and note what we would change going forward (and what Jake did change when revising the course for senior-level undergraduate criminology majors)."

    "title": "Introduction to Statistics in R for Criminologists",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The following assignments were created for Jon’s undergraduate statistics course (CJUS K300) with the help of Tyeisha Fordham, a PhD student at Indiana University. Here is an abridged syllabus for the course. Most of the assignments are based on exercises found in Bachman, Paternoster, & Wilson’s Statistics for Criminology & Criminal Justice, 5th Ed., which we refer to throughout as “BPW” book.\nThese assignments are designed to provide a (relatively) gentle introduction to elementary foundations of frequentist statistics using R via R Studio & R Markdown. Though initially designed for undergraduate students, the course is comparable to many introductory statistics courses that graduate students take in pursuit of Masters or PhD degrees in criminology/criminal justice. Hence, the R assignments may also provide a helpful bridge for graduate students prior to taking more advanced statistics courses that use R and, likewise, may be useful for criminologists at any educational or career stages interested in learning to use R for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1: Getting Started in R\nThe purpose of this first assignment is to demonstrate that you have downloaded the “base R” and “RStudio” statistical programs and can open a SPSS datafile in RStudio. Additionally, you will learn how to create, edit, and knit an R Markdown file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 2: Navigating Data\nIn this assignment, you will create an R Markdown file in which to save and present your work for this class. Additionally, following the goals of BPW’s chapter 1, you will use R/RStudio to view variables in a data file and find information about variables, including variable names, labels, and values. This assignment should help you navigate R/RStudio and become comfortable finding basic information within data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 3: Describing Data Distributions\nChapters 2 & 3 of B&P’s book focused on data distributions and displaying data with tabular or graphical representations. In this assignment, you will learn how to recode variables, generate frequency tables, and create simple graphs in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 4: Central Tendency\nBPW’s chapter 4 focused on measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, and mode,) and their advantages and disadvantages as single statistical descriptions of a data distribution. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to use R to calculate measures of central tendency and other statistics (e.g., skewness; kurtosis) that us help standardize and efficiently describe the shape of a data distribution. You will also get additional practice with creating frequency tables and simple graphs in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 5: Dispersion\nBPW’s chapter 5 covered measures of dispersion, including variation ratio, range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation. We use measures of dispersion to summarize the “spread” (rather than central tendency) of a data distribution. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to use R to calculate measures of dispersion and create boxplots that help us standardize and efficiently describe the spread of a data distribution. You will also get additional practice with creating frequency tables and simple graphs in R, and you will learn how to modify some elements (e.g., color) of a ggplot object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 6: Probability & Cross-tabulations\nBPW’s chapter 6 provided an introduction to probability, including foundational rules of probability and probability distributions. In the current assignment, you will gain a better understanding of frequentist probability by learning to create and interpret cross-tabulations or joint frequency contingency tables and by calculating z-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 7: Sampling Variability & Confidence Intervals\nIn this assignment, we dig deeper into the process of making statistical inferences about population parameters from sample statistics. For instance, you will learn to think about sample descriptive statistics (e.g., a sample mean or correlation coefficient) as point estimates of population parameters. Relatedly, following BPW’s chapter 7, you will learn how to calculate confidence intervals around a point estimate in R and to interpret them appropriately. Additionally, you will learn how to simulate data from a probability distribution, which should help you better understand sampling variability and the need for interval estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 8: One-sample Null Hypothesis Test\nFollowing BPW’s chapter 8, in this assignment you will learn how to conduct a two-tail z-test and t-test and then, given the test results and the null hypothesis, to make an appropriate inference about the population parameter by either rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. Along the way, you will explore plots of data distributions from random samples drawn from simulated population data. This exploration is intended to help you visualize the sampling distribution of a sample mean, which should lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that allow us to make valid population inferences from samples with null hypothesis significance testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 9: Chi-squared Test of Independence\nAs in BPW’s chapter 9, in this assignment you will learn how to make population inferences about the relationship between two categorical variables by conducting a chi-squared test of independence on a sample contingency table (crosstab). Additionally, we will briefly introduce you to the phi-coefficient and Cramer’s V, two measures of association that can be interpreted to describe the strength of an association between variables in a crosstab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 10: Two-sample Null Hypothesis Test\nBPW’s chapter 10 focused on null hypothesis tests to make inferences about the equality of two group means or proportions using sample data. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to make an inference about the (in)equality of two population group means by conducting an independent sample t-test and then determining whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in population group means. We will also use simulations to visualize the sampling distribution of sample mean differences, briefly introduce Levene’s test of equality of population group variances, and introduce the half-violin/half-dotplot as a way to visualize variable distributions and potential outliers for two (or more) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 11: Correlation & Regression\nStay tuned - coming soon."
