    "title": "Introduction to Statistics in R for Criminologists",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The following assignments were created for Jon’s undergraduate statistics course (CJUS K300) with the help of Tyeisha Fordham, a PhD student at Indiana University. Here is an abridged syllabus for the course. Most of the assignments are based on exercises found in Bachman, Paternoster, & Wilson’s Statistics for Criminology & Criminal Justice, 5th Ed., which we refer to throughout as “BPW” book.\nThis course is designed as a (relatively) gentle introduction to elementary foundations of frequentist statistics using R via R Studio & R Markdown. Though initially designed for undergraduate students, the course is comparable to many introductory statistics courses that graduate students take in pursuit of Masters or PhD degrees in criminology/criminal justice. It may also provide a helpful bridge for graduate students prior to taking more advanced statistics courses that use R and, likewise, may be useful for criminologists at any educational or career stages interested in learning to use R for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1: Getting Started in R\nThe purpose of this first assignment is to demonstrate that you have downloaded the “base R” and “RStudio” statistical programs and can open a SPSS datafile in RStudio. Additionally, you will learn how to create, edit, and knit an R Markdown file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 2: Navigating Data\nIn this assignment, you will create an R Markdown file in which to save and present your work for this class. Additionally, following the goals of BPW’s chapter 1, you will use R/RStudio to view variables in a data file and find information about variables, including variable names, labels, and values. This assignment should help you navigate R/RStudio and become comfortable finding basic information within data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 3: Describing Data Distributions\nChapters 2 & 3 of B&P’s book focused on data distributions and displaying data with tabular or graphical representations. In this assignment, you will learn how to recode variables, generate frequency tables, and create simple graphs in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 4: Central Tendency\nBPW’s chapter 4 focused on measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, and mode,) and their advantages and disadvantages as single statistical descriptions of a data distribution. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to use R to calculate measures of central tendency and other statistics (e.g., skewness; kurtosis) that us help standardize and efficiently describe the shape of a data distribution. You will also get additional practice with creating frequency tables and simple graphs in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 5: Dispersion\nBPW’s chapter 5 covered measures of dispersion, including variation ratio, range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation. We use measures of dispersion to summarize the “spread” (rather than central tendency) of a data distribution. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to use R to calculate measures of dispersion and create boxplots that help us standardize and efficiently describe the spread of a data distribution. You will also get additional practice with creating frequency tables and simple graphs in R, and you will learn how to modify some elements (e.g., color) of a ggplot object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 6: Probability & Cross-tabulations\nBPW’s chapter 6 provided an introduction to probability, including foundational rules of probability and probability distributions. In the current assignment, you will gain a better understanding of frequentist probability by learning to create and interpret cross-tabulations or joint frequency contingency tables and by calculating z-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 7: Sampling Variability & Confidence Intervals\nIn this assignment, we dig deeper into the process of making statistical inferences about population parameters from sample statistics. For instance, you will learn to think about sample descriptive statistics (e.g., a sample mean or correlation coefficient) as point estimates of population parameters. Relatedly, following BPW’s chapter 7, you will learn how to calculate confidence intervals around a point estimate in R and to interpret them appropriately. Additionally, you will learn how to simulate data from a probability distribution, which should help you better understand sampling variability and the need for interval estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 8: One-sample Null Hypothesis Test\nFollowing BPW’s chapter 8, in this assignment you will learn how to conduct a two-tail z-test and t-test and then, given the test results and the null hypothesis, to make an appropriate inference about the population parameter by either rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. Along the way, you will explore plots of data distributions from random samples drawn from simulated population data. This exploration is intended to help you visualize the sampling distribution of a sample mean, which should lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that allow us to make valid population inferences from samples with null hypothesis significance testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 9: Chi-squared Test of Independence\nAs in BPW’s chapter 9, in this assignment you will learn how to make population inferences about the relationship between two categorical variables by conducting a chi-squared test of independence on a sample contingency table (crosstab). Additionally, we will briefly introduce you to the phi-coefficient and Cramer’s V, two measures of association that can be interpreted to describe the strength of an association between variables in a crosstab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 10: Two-sample Null Hypothesis Test\nBPW’s chapter 10 focused on null hypothesis tests to make inferences about the equality of two group means or proportions using sample data. Likewise, in this assignment, you will learn how to make an inference about the (in)equality of two population group means by conducting an independent sample t-test and then determining whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in population group means. We will also use simulations to visualize the sampling distribution of sample mean differences, briefly introduce Levene’s test of equality of population group variances, and introduce the half-violin/half-dotplot as a way to visualize variable distributions and potential outliers for two (or more) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 11: Correlation & Regression\nStay tuned - coming soon."

    "text": "In the fall of 2021, Jon was on the schedule to teach a new course titled “Replication & Reproducibility in Social Science” as a substitute for IU Criminal Justice Department’s typical graduate “Methods” degree requirement. The same semester, Jake was scheduled to teach the “Social Research Methods” course to first-year MA students in UNCW’s Department of Sociology and Criminology. He decided to join Jon in revising the class to focus on replication and reproducibility. The result was a jointly designed course focusing on replication and reproducibility issues broadly across the social sciences, but with specific examples from sociology and criminology. You can take a look at both Jon’s syllabus and Jake’s syllabus for the course. They are basically identical, but Jon’s syllabus includes a complete reference list for the assigned and recommended readings. Also, because of a weird scheduling quirk, Jake had to combine two weeks into one (Hype and Perverse Incentives).\nIn addition to teaching them about replication and reproducibility issues more generally, we also wanted to help them learn some practical skills to help them produce more reliable and transparent research. To do this, we had them complete two sets of assignments: 1) R Assignments intended to provide a basic introduction to conducting reproducible research using the R Statistical Computing Environment and RStudio and 2) a Reproducibility Project where they had the reproduce the (descriptive) results of a published article on a topic of interest to them. The “R Assignments” ended up being a basic introduction to data wrangling, data visualization and reporting, and reproducible workflow with a primary emphasis on the Tidyverse suite of packages. The “Reproducibility Project” was an opportunity for students to apply these new skills to a topic that interested them, get their hands dirty with real-world data, and develop an appreciated of the difficulties involved in computationally reproducing published work when you do not have access to the code used to clean, wrangle and analyze the data.\nWe have included these assignments as they were assigned in Jon’s class with light editing, where necessary, for student privacy reasons. In a forthcoming blog post we will discuss what we learned from designing this course and note what we would change going forward (and what Jake did change when revising the course for senior-level undergraduate criminology majors)."

The specific activities were inspired by the SPSS Exercises from the end of Chapter 1 in Bachman and Paternoster’s Statistics for Criminology & Criminal Justice, 4th Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Reproduced from Figure 1 on pg. 22 in Warr (1993).\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 3: Introduction to R Markdown\nThe purpose of this assignment is to reproduce findings from a published study in R, particularly one where the data are housed on ICPSR. In order to accomplish this we will need to do and learn the following: - Identify the data being used in the now classic study by Mark Warr published in Criminology titled: “Age, Peers, and Delinquency” (Warr, 1993) - Download it from ICPSR - Identify and wrangle the specific variables/items used in the study using the dplyr package that is a part of the Tidyverse. - Combine multiple data sets into one. - Reproduce the first part of Figure 1 from Warr’s (1993) study (as displayed on pg. 22 in his article) by introducing you to the powerful data visualization package ggplot2, which is also a part of the Tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n Reproduced from Table 1 on pg. 348 in Orcutt, 1987\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 4: Conceptual Replication\nThe purpose of this assignment is to perform a conceptual replication of some observations in Orcutt’s (1987) paper in Criminology titled: “Differential Association and Marijuana Use: A Closer Look at Sutherland (with a Little Help from Becker).” Since Orcutt’s (1987) original data are unavailable, we will assess whether some of his findings can be repeated with and generalize to a similar sample in the NYS data."

A secondary purpose of this assignment is to develop a sense of how (un)common it is to find research articles in the top journals of your field for which the authors have openly shared their data and code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Assignment 2: Describe Reproduction, Share Image, Summarize Data\nUnlike previous assignments, this assignment was not organized into various numbered “parts” for students to follow and complete. Rather, it showed students some basics about publishing with R Markdown (e.g., inserting an image, editing the YAML header, etc.) and asked students to summarize the raw versions of the variables needed for their reproduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Assignment 3: First Draft of Reproduction\nStudents are asked to create a first draft of their reproduction project which was ultimately peer-reviewed by one of their classmates. The directions are similar to Project Assignment 2 except students were expected to recode all variables and produce relatively clean and publication-ready versions of their tables and figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Assignment 4: Final Draft of Reproduction\nStudents are asked to finalize their reproduction project and provide a reproducible file structure. Essentially, they were asked to apply the skills they had learned throughout the course to produce an article or blog reproducing some (descriptive) results of a published study."

Inside that file, you should include:\n\nRMarkdown file to reproduce your work\nClean knitted html document from your RMarkdown file (this should be automatically produced when you knit the document in RStudio).\nThe file structure necessary to reproduce your work independently.\n\nNote: This means that any file or folder you are referencing in your RMarkdown file but not creating within the RMarkdown file (e.g., with dir.create or icpsr_download commands), you should include in your Project-Assignment-4 folder (e.g., you need to include the “Images” of the published table/figure you are reproducing).\n\n\n\nEvaluation & Feedback\nHere are some things I will look for when evaluating/providing feedback:\n\nDescription/Justification: Does the author describe and justify the reproduction project aims clearly and effectively? Is the original study included in one of the project folders? Can I find the table or figure in the original study that the author is attempting to reproduce? Is the original study and that specific table/figure described clearly and accurately? Do they link to and cite the published study in the RMarkdown file?\nDescription of procedures and results throughout the document: Do you write about what you are doing throughout the markdown file? In other words, are you describing what you are doing and what you are finding in the data (e.g., are your descriptives the same as the original article, are they different? Is there anything unclear in the original article that makes it difficult to decipher exactly how they coded a variable?)? See R Assignment #3 or R Assignment #4 Wallkthrough/Instructions for some examples of this.\nProject File Structure: Is the RMarkdown file in the “root” folder of the shared drive? Are there separate and clearly marked folders following best practices (e.g., Data; Articles; Images)? Can I open the RMarkdown file and run it with one click?\nR Code Reproducibility: After installing any necessary packages, can I successfully run all R Code chunks, or does running the code generate errors? If errors are generated, is it immediately obvious what those errors are, and can I fix them with minimal effort to continue the review of R Code chunks?\nMiscellaneous: You may also want to consider a brief conclusion summarizing what you learned from the project and any issues you encountered with reproducing the results of the published article. The main idea for the project is for you to write a report of your reproducibility project, preferably one that could ultimately be publishable (e.g. in an online blog or website. or maybe even a journal article or research note)."
