    "text": "This report presents the results of consulting work done to support an innovative community-based survey project conducted in Kansas City, Missouri, that, among other things, sought to understand residents’ perceptions of neighborhood safety, collective efficacy, and police-community relations. The project represents a significant methodological advancement in community research by employing community members as interviewers to reach populations typically underrepresented in traditional municipal surveys. Indeed, the Kansas City Community Survey emerged from recognition of a critical gap in municipal research: traditional survey methods might fail to effectively capture the voices and experiences of residents in high-crime neighborhoods who may be most affected by public safety policies but least likely to participate in conventional data collection efforts.\nOur role was to support the Principal Investigator, Dr. Marijana Kotlaja, in designing the survey instrument and applying advanced analytical techniques in her effort to thoughtfully combine community-engaged methodology with analytical and methodological sophistication in order to produce both methodological innovation and substantive insights into neighborhood social processes.\n\n\n\n\nBrauer, Jonathan, and Jacob Day. 2025. “Pursuing Precision in Criminology: Why Ordinal Data Demand Ordinal Methods.” OSF. https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fet4d_v1.\n\n\nDay, Jake, Jon Brauer, and Maja Kotlaja. 2023. “Trust Issues: Examining Near Duplicates in Survey Data.” https://reluctantcriminologists.com/blog-posts/%5B8%5D/dup-series/duplicates.\n\n\nKuriakose, Noble, and Michael Robbins. 2015. “Don’t Get Duped: Fraud Through Duplication in Public Opinion Surveys.” {SSRN} {Scholarly} {Paper}.

(See Bivariate Manhattan Plots section 5.0.7.)\nItem-Level Insights: Specific dimensions, particularly trust-related aspects of social cohesion and willingness to intervene in clearly problematic situations, drive relationships with crime perceptions more than others. (See Item-total Correlations section 5.0.6 and Bivariate Manhattan Plots section 5.0.7.)\nThreshold Effects: Many relationships showed diminishing returns at higher levels of collective efficacy, suggesting neighborhood thresholds or “tipping points” at which low control or cohesion might become particularly problematic. (See Bivariate Mosaic Plots section 5.0.4.)\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Geographic Patterns\nSpatial analysis revealed clear clustering patterns across Kansas City neighborhoods (See Mapping Survey Data section 6.0.5.):\n\nHigh collective efficacy concentrated in northern and western parts of the city.\nLower collective efficacy clustered in south and eastern areas, particularly around the central business district.\nCrime alignment: Geographic patterns largely aligned with both official crime statistics and residents’ perceptions of safety.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Perceptions vs. Reality\nThe analysis describes important patterns in how residents perceive crime (See Crime Rate & Survey Data section 6.0.6.3):\n\nAccurate violent crime perception: Residents appeared to accurately perceive violent crime (high and low rates) in their neighborhoods.\nContext matters: Most neighborhoods showed consistency between official violent crime rates and residents’ perceived violence and expected victimization risks. Yet, in several neighborhoods with moderate to high official violent crime rates, residents reported low perceived violence and low expected victimization risks, while a few neighborhoods exhibited the opposite pattern (low official violence rates and moderate to high perceived violence and expected victimization).",

    "text": "3.1 Theoretical Framework and Research Context\nThe project is, in part, grounded in collective efficacy theory, developed by Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls (1997), which posits that neighborhoods with strong social cohesion and informal social control are better able to prevent crime and maintain safety. This theory has become foundational to understanding how neighborhood social processes influence crime rates, but most research has relied on traditional survey methods that may systematically exclude the very communities where these processes are most critical to understand.\nThe analyses presented in this report extends this research by examining collective efficacy through multiple analytical lenses: individual-level relationships between social cohesion, informal social control, and crime perceptions; neighborhood-level aggregation and spatial analysis; and methodological comparison with established municipal survey instruments. This multi-faceted approach provides both validation of existing theory and new insights into how collective efficacy operates across diverse urban neighborhoods.",

Rather than relying solely on mail, phone, or online surveys - methods that can suffer from low response rates in high-crime neighborhoods - the project employed community members as trained interviewers. This approach was designed to build trust, reduce barriers to participation, and capture authentic community perspectives on sensitive topics like policing and neighborhood safety.\nThe survey sampled 40 Kansas City neighborhoods using a stratified design that included both randomly selected neighborhoods and purposively selected high-crime areas. This sampling strategy allowed for comparison between different neighborhood contexts while ensuring adequate representation from communities that are often excluded from municipal research. The resulting dataset includes responses from 386 residents across diverse neighborhood contexts, with particularly strong representation from high-crime areas relative to the city’s traditional annual resident survey.",

This methodological choice provides more accurate estimates of relationships between variables while demonstrating the value of using statistically appropriate methods for survey data.\nSpatial Analysis: The analysis includes mapping and spatial analysis that examines how collective efficacy and crime perceptions cluster geographically across Kansas City neighborhoods.

Practically, it may also offer a model for how municipalities can gather more inclusive and representative data to inform policy decisions.\nOur hope is that the analyses presented in this report can help show that the Kansas City Community Survey project represents more than a methodological experiment. It may demonstrate a pathway toward more inclusive, community-centered research that serves both scientific understanding and community empowerment.

    "text": "4.0.1 Introduction\nIn our contract with Dr. Kotlaja, we mentioned performing data quality checks and specifically duplication analyses. Analyzing duplicate survey responses has been put forward as potential tool in analyzing the quality of data and potentially identifying fraud. Although we have some reservations about the utility of near duplication analyses for identifying fraudulent interviewer behavior (see Day, Brauer, and Kotlaja, 2023), we do think it’s a useful way to learn about one’s data. And, given the unique features of the data collection process (e.g., using community members to administer the surveys), such analyses may serve as an entree to examining interviewer effects in the quality of the data.\nBelow we will walk through two approaches to analyzing duplication in survey data. First, we’ll check for exact duplicates. Second, we’ll examine near-duplication using the method proposed by Kuriakose and Robbins (2016).\nIn doing this, we’ll utilize the combined version of the community survey data we created in the previous data cleaning overview. However, we’ll trim the data so that it only includes substantive variables of interest and not administrative variables or, in this case, the variables that asked respondents to identify their neighborhood boundaries. We also removed basic demographic variables (e.g., sex, age, race/ethnicity) as these are often used in sampling designs and are thus less apt to be erroneously duplicated (see footnote 9 on p.286 in Kuriakose and Robbins’ article). We also removed most of the variables where respondents entered text (often identified with a “TEXT” suffix to the variable name)1. Most of these were missing and unlikely to be directly duplicated. We also removed the variables (Q31_10 - Q31_18) related to neighborhood monitoring platforms (e.g., Next Door) as these included a lot of missing data and Q30 already asked a “yes/no” question about whether the respondent used such platforms. We also converted to the employment variables (respondents’ employment status and other household adult’s employment status) to single variables rather than the 10 variables across which each potential employment status was indicated.\nShow code\n# RUN THIS MANUALLY IN R CONSOLE BEFORE RENDERING:\n# Identifies necessary packages for FULL project & install as needed \n# (This code is not executed during rendering to avoid hanging)\n\n# Check and install renv if needed\nif (!requireNamespace(\"renv\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  cat(\"renv package not found.

We are going to forgo removing other variables that may have more than 10% missing as well as observations with 25% or more missing as this is simply an initial check. In this way, we are being conservative in our approach and allowing for a potentially higher rate of near duplication than actually exists. If we find potentially problematic near duplication, we can always go back to the more stringent standards outlined by Kuriakose and Robbins (2016).\nUltimatley, the trimmed data set has 205 variables, 71 less than the raw version of the combined data.\nBefore moving on, let’s take a look at the basic descriptive and distributional features of the data to make sure there is nothing else we think should be removed prior to looking for duplicates.\nShow code\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\nkc_combsurv_noad %&gt;%\n  haven::zap_labels() %&gt;%\n  select(-ID) %&gt;%\n  datasummary_skim(output = \"kableExtra\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"),\n    fixed_thead = TRUE,\n    full_width = TRUE,\n    html_font = \"Arial\",\n    font_size = 12,\n    position = \"left\",\n    latex_options = \"scale_down\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"500px\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique\nMissing Pct.\nMean\nSD\nMin\nMedian\nMax\n\n\n\n\nOn the whole, do you like or dislike this neighborhood as a place to live?\n5\n3\n1.7\n0.7\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n\n\nSuppose that for some reason, you HAD to move away from this neighborhood.

Here, we are going to start by focusing on the items meant to measure (and conceptually replicate) Sampson et al.’s (1997) concept of “collective efficacy.” In doing so, we will examine collective efficacy’s relationship to violence (perceived neighborhood violence and self-reported violent victimization) in these data and descriptively replicate the core part of Sampson et al.’s (1997) foundational study. Unlike Sampson and colleagues, however, we will center our analyses on the item-specific effects and utilize an ordinal modeling approach that better captures the inherent data-generating process enforced by Likert-type questions used to measure the key variables of interest.1\nShow code\nkc_combsurv_clean &lt;- readRDS(here(\"Data\", \"kc_combsurv_clean.rds\"))",

    "text": "6.0.1 Introduction\nIn the previous chapter, we analyzed bivariate relationships between item- and scale-level measures of collective efficacy and perceived and experienced criminal behaviors in residents’ neighborhoods. We found that individuals who perceive their neighborhood to be high in collective efficacy (at least for certain items meant to measure the key sub-dimensions of collective efficacy–social cohesion and informal social control) generally perceived less crime in their neighborhood and, to a lesser extent, report fewer direct experiences with criminal victimization. Of course, the theory of collective efficacy was not developed to explain individual-level differences in neighborhood perceptions and crime. Rather, it was conceived as a collective neighborhood-level corollary to the classic psychological concept of self-efficacy. Instead of emphasizing an individual’s belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a specific task, collective efficacy is meant to capture a community or neighborhood’s collective “mutual trust or willingness to intervene for the common good…(Sampson et al., 1997: p. 919)” such as controlling crime and antisocial behavior. With this in mind, we turn to visualizing neighborhood-level variations in collective efficacy and crime below.",

    "text": "8.1.1 Summary of Key Findings\nThe preceding analysis of the Kansas City Community Survey provides evidence that community-engaged research methodologies can successfully bridge the gap between rigorous social science and authentic community participation while generating insights that advance both theoretical understanding and practical policy development. Across four interconnected analyses our results provide compelling evidence for the viability and value of community-based approaches to understanding neighborhood social processes.\nPerhaps the project’s most fundamental contribution lies in demonstrating that community members can serve as effective data collectors while maintaining scientific standards. The duplication analysis (see Section 4.0.1) revealed minimal data quality issues, with only one case of true duplication among 386 responses and no evidence of systematic fabrication. This finding is particularly significant given that community-based data collection could theoretically increase risks of data manipulation, yet the results show the opposite—high integrity data collection coupled with successful engagement of typically underrepresented populations.\nSubstantively, the analysis provides strong support for collective efficacy theory (see Section 5.0.1) while revealing important nuances in how neighborhood social processes (see Section 6.0.1) relate to crime and safety. The item-level analysis demonstrates that while collective efficacy operates largely as theorized, certain dimensions—particularly trust-related aspects of social cohesion and intervention in clearly problematic situations—drive the relationships with crime perceptions more than others. This finding has important implications for both theory development and intervention design.\nThe survey comparison analysis (see Section 7.0.1) demonstrated that community-engaged methodology not only maintains scientific validity but reveals potentially critical limitations in traditional municipal survey approaches. While both survey methods produced remarkably similar results when adequate sample sizes were achieved, the traditional resident survey’s systematic under-representation of high-crime neighborhoods (17 vs. 88 respondents) rendered most comparisons statistically meaningless for precisely those communities most affected by public safety policies.",

    "text": "8.2 Methodological Contributions and Innovations\n\n8.2.1 Community-Engaged Data Collection\nThe project’s most significant methodological contribution is demonstrating that community-based interviewing can achieve multiple objectives simultaneously: maintaining data quality, reaching underrepresented populations, and building community capacity. The comparison with Kansas City’s annual resident survey shows that while the community approach produced substantively similar results on key measures when neighborhood context was controlled, it successfully engaged 88 residents from high-crime neighborhoods (22.8% of sample) compared to only 17 residents (6.5% of sample) in the traditional survey of the same 40 neighborhoods, or a five-fold improvement in representation that nearly eliminates geographic sampling disparities.\n\n\n8.2.2 Advanced Analytical Approaches\nThe preceding analysis also demonstrates the value of several analytical innovations that could be adopted more widely in community research:\nItem-Level Analysis: Rather than relying solely on aggregate scales, the analysis reveals important heterogeneity within collective efficacy that would be obscured by traditional scale-based approaches. This methodological choice provides more nuanced understanding of how neighborhood social processes operate and offers more precise targets for intervention.\nOrdinal Modeling Techniques: The use of polychoric correlations, mosaic plots, and other methods specifically designed for ordinal data provides more accurate estimates of relationships while demonstrating that methodological choices matter for substantive conclusions. The comparison between Pearson’s r and polychoric correlations, for example, shows how traditional linear approaches may overestimate some relationships.\nSpatial Integration: The bivariate choropleth mapping approach provides a way to visualize complex relationships between neighborhood characteristics and outcomes, revealing spatial patterns that inform both theory and policy while making research findings more accessible to community stakeholders.\n\n\n8.2.3 Validation and Quality Assurance\nThe project’s comprehensive approach to validation—including duplication analysis, comparison with established surveys, and spatial verification—provides a model for how community-engaged research can maintain scientific rigor. This systematic approach to quality assurance addresses potential skepticism about community-based methods while establishing standards that other projects can adopt.",

    "section": "8.3 Theoretical Insights and Contributions",
    "text": "8.3 Theoretical Insights and Contributions\n\n8.3.1 Collective Efficacy Theory\nThe analysis provides general support for collective efficacy theory while suggesting important refinements. The finding that social control shows stronger and more consistent relationships with crime outcomes than social cohesion suggests that the “informal social control” component may be more central to crime prevention than previously understood. This insight has implications for how researchers conceptualize and measure collective efficacy and how communities might focus their capacity-building efforts.\nThe threshold effects observed in many relationships—where improvements in collective efficacy have diminishing returns at higher levels—suggest that collective efficacy may function more as a protective factor against neighborhood decline than as a continuous predictor across all contexts. This finding has important implications for intervention strategies and resource allocation.\n\n\n8.3.2 Perceptions vs. Official Statistics\nThe spatial analysis reveals a potential disconnect between residents’ perceptions of violence and official crime statistics, particularly for property crime. Residents appear to accurately perceive violent crime but may be less attuned to property crime patterns, suggesting that different types of crime have different impacts on neighborhood social processes and resident experiences. This finding highlights the importance of understanding both objective conditions and subjective experiences in neighborhood research and policy development.\n\n\n8.3.3 Geographic Clustering and Spatial Patterns\nThe spatial analysis demonstrates clear geographic clustering of both collective efficacy and crime-related outcomes, with higher collective efficacy concentrated in northern Kansas City and lower collective efficacy in south and eastern areas. This spatial patterning aligns with broader patterns of urban inequality while providing specific insights into how neighborhood social processes are distributed across the city.",

The successful integration of community-based interviewing with traditional survey methods suggests that cities can enhance their data collection approaches without abandoning established instruments or losing comparability over time.\nFor Kansas City specifically, the findings suggest that future resident surveys could benefit from incorporating community-based components, particularly in neighborhoods that have been historically underrepresented. The methodology could also be applied to other policy domains where community input is essential but difficult to obtain through traditional means. The community-engaged approach applied here effectively demonstrates that achieving both statistical reliability and democratic representation is possible and necessary for equitable governance.\n\n\n8.4.2 Neighborhood-Based Interventions\nThe item-level findings provide specific guidance for neighborhood-based interventions aimed at building collective efficacy. Rather than generic “community building” approaches, interventions could focus on specific mechanisms that show the strongest relationships with safety outcomes:\n\nBuilding trust and addressing interpersonal conflict (addressing the “neighbors don’t get along” and “neighbors can be trusted” dimensions)\nDeveloping capacity for intervention in clearly problematic situations (supporting willingness to “break up fights” and “organize to keep fire stations open”)\nStrengthening informal networks that support both social cohesion and collective action\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Police-Community Relations\nThe finding that police-related measures showed remarkable consistency across survey methods suggests that residents’ perceptions of police services are relatively stable and reliable indicators that can inform policy development. The geographic variation in these perceptions, combined with the spatial clustering of collective efficacy, provides specific guidance for where police-community relation efforts might be most needed and most effective.",

The methodology appears particularly well-suited for research on sensitive topics where trust and rapport are essential for obtaining honest responses. Other municipalities and research organizations could adapt this approach for investigating police-community relations, neighborhood safety, civic engagement, and other domains where community participation is both methodologically important and ethically necessary.\n\n\n8.5.2 Capacity Building and Empowerment\nBeyond its research contributions, the project demonstrates how community-engaged methodology can serve capacity-building and empowerment functions. By training community members as interviewers and involving them in the research process, the project builds local research capacity while ensuring that research serves community as well as academic objectives.\n\n\n8.5.3 Democratic Participation in Research\nThe project contributes to broader conversations about who participates in research and how research can serve democratic ends. By successfully engaging residents who are typically excluded from municipal research, the project demonstrates that methodological innovation can advance both scientific and democratic objectives simultaneously. The survey comparison particularly underscores this point by revealing how traditional methods can create a form of ‘statistical disenfranchisement,’ where certain communities’ voices are not just underrepresented but statistically unreliable even when included.",

The substantive findings advance our understanding of collective efficacy and neighborhood social processes while providing insights for community members and policy-makers to consider in developing policies and community interventions.\nAs cities across the United States and beyond grapple with issues of neighborhood safety, police-community relations, and civic engagement, the Kansas City Community Survey project provides both methodological tools and substantive insights that can inform more effective and equitable approaches to urban governance and community development.

    "text": "12.2 Planned research design\nThe KC Community Surveyed conducted computer-assisted personal interviews (on tablets) with adults identified using stratified probability sampling of urban households in Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO). A two-stage stratified probability sampling procedure with stratified random oversampling was used to randomly select households in neighborhoods representing the general population living in each of the six KCMO administrative districts while also ensuring sufficient sampling coverage of households in neighborhoods identified as likely targets of crime-reduction initiatives.\nThe P.I. initially secured funding for a sample size of n=800 respondents age 18 and older. Since the results of the Census of population, households and dwellings in KC from 2020 show that there are 508,090 persons registered in KC metro, of which 400,050 are age 18 and older. Considering the specified sample size, the sample error, with confidence level of 95%, was estimated to be ±3.46% ( p≤0.05).\n\nCouncil districts represented the first level of stratification (total of 6 districts)\n\n\n5 randomly selected NH per each district (5 NH * 6 districts = 30 randomly selected NH)\n\n\nNeighborhood represented the second level of stratification (40 out of a total of 240 neighborhoods)\n\n\n30 randomly selected NH (6 per district)\n10 strategically selected NH to oversample “high risk” NH with 10 highest violent crime rates as of the most recent official data from KC police, as these NH are places where anti-crime interventions are most likely to be implemented\n\n\nIn each NH, 1 adult per household (HH) from 10 HH around 2 random starting points per NH were selected for interview (1 adult * 10 HH * 2 SP per NH = 20 adults per NH; 800 adults total)\n\nGeneralizability of the sample was maximized via random selection of starting points, random selection of households within cluster, and random selection of the household member selected for interview.\nTo conduct the survey, for each district the necessary number of starting points (two per neighborhood) were randomly selected from the total base of starting points (neighborhoods), using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21 (SPSS 21). At any selected starting point, no more than ten (10) surveys were permitted to be completed. In addition, additional substitute random starting points were selected as well so that, during fieldwork, when a need arised for additional starting points or to alter some of them (e.g., inaccessible; non-residential; etc.), a pre-determined principled probability sampling approach would be used.\nIn each of the areas covered by the randomly chosen starting point, households in which surveys were conducted were selected using a pre-determined Random Walk Technique (e.g., see here), which was aided and simplified using pre-specified random walking routes displayed for interviewers using mapping software on an assigned interviewer tablet. This classical method was used due to insufficient proper lists of residents, which, given their consistent use and non-systematic biases in survey non-participation, should have enabled the researchers to meet their desired goal of sample representativeness.\nWhere necessary, the selected starting or interview points, interviewers were instructed to make selections using the “right hand rule”. For example, when interviewers arrived at the address noted, they would turn facing away from the starting point and move to her/his right. The first household the interviewers encountered would have represented the household where first survey should be attempted to be conducted. The interviewers were then instructed to continue to move in the same direction and on the same side of the street, and using the principle of selecting every third address, further selecting households where surveying would be conducted, all until the anticipated number of surveys for that starting point were complete.\nIn each of the households, the selection of respondents was performed by applying the Last Birthday Technique, which should have ensured a random selection of respondents within a household. Therefore, the household member older than 18 years of age who had most recently had a birthday, that is, the household member whose birth date is the closest to the date of contact was selected for invitation to be surveyed. If the person who had last had a birthday was absent (or for other non-contact reasons, e.g., no answer), the interviewer was instructed to arrange a different time for interviewing and/or a member of the research team would return to that household, before conducting the survey with another respondent from another household.\nDue to various implementation challenges (e.g., community-engaged volunteering and training hurdles; lower than expected response rates; longer than expected survey administration time), some deviations occurred (e.g., supplemented online administration option at end in effort to increase participation rates for those lacking time for in-person interview), and the final “total” and “per-neighborhood” sample sizes were significantly smaller (e.g., approximately n=386 surveys; see report analysis sections for more details). The project P.I. (Dr. Marijana Kotlaja) would know more about specific design and implementation details or deviations.",

The first 4 SP will be the addresses that interviewers will begin attempting to interview residents and from which they will systematically move to new potential addresses. The remaining 4 SP will be reserve SP to be used in the event that interview quotas (5 per SP) are not met in an initially selected SP. We later sampled 5 additional backup SPs per neighborhood (for 13 total) to be used if the first 8 selected were exhausted or otherwise unusable.\nThough we share the code, to retain confidentiality, it is commented out or not evaluated and the corresponding randomly selected SP address file is not included.\nAfter this, we sampled one additional neighborhood (NH) to replace an originally selected NH (due to lack of responses or valid residencies).\n\n12.3.1 Load libraries & data\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(here)\n\n# spdata &lt;- read_excel(\"study_addresses.xls\")\n# spdata\n\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Sample 8 SP per Neighborhood\n\n\nShow code\nset.seed(1138)\n\nspsamp &lt;- spdata %&gt;%\n  group_by(KCMO_NeighborhoodsCensus.NBHID) %&gt;%\n  slice_sample(n=8, replace=FALSE)\nspsamp\n\n\nSome of these starting points are unusable (e.g., building address demolished).

Three NHs were eliminated from the sampling frame due to identification as industrial districts. After stratified random sampling of 30 NHs, another 10 NHs were strategically selected for inclusion as potential targets of violent crime initiatives by starting at the top of a list of NHs with the highest reported violent crime rates in 2023 and selecting the first 10 that were not already included in the stratified random sample of 30 NHs.\nThe following 30 NHs were selected via stratified random sampling of 5 NHs within each of 6 council districts.

Rockhill (District 4)\nCunningham Ridge was a strategically sampled NH. Dr. Kotlaja’s team replaced it with Oak Park Southwest, which was the next NH on the list of high violent crime rates.\nRockhill was selected via stratified random sampling as one of the original 5 NHs in District 4.

She wanted to know if that design would provide sufficient statistical power to examine various individual- and neighborhood-level differences (e.g., in collective efficacy; perceptions of police; general perceptions). Given initial preferences regarding the target sample size and lacking a specific target test hypothesis for which I could specify a reasonably precise modeling approach and plausible range of effect sizes, I took a different approach.

    "text": "13.2 Assumptions\nAssume we can meaningfully distinguish at the outset between adults in high risk neighborhoods from those in non-high risk neighborhoods; high risk neighborhoods experience high rates of serious violent and property crimes and, as such, are likely targets for anti-crime interventions. Assume, too, that we want to know if there are substantively meaningful differences across these neighborhood risk levels in various things such as adult residents’ involvement in neighborhood organizations, their perceived agreement with the neighborhood or with police services, or reported indicators of collective efficacy (e.g., social control; cohesion) in the neighborhood.\nLet’s use a couple concrete examples from the PHDCN’s community survey for our power analysis.\nPeople might differ in the degree to which residents perceive that people in their neighborhood can be trusted or that people are willing to help their neighbors, and residents of “not at risk” (i.e., lower crime) neighborhoods might report greater agreement with such statements than those in “at risk (i.e., higher crime) neighborhoods.\nThe PHDCN community survey contains a series of questions like this to measure dimensions of collective efficacy using ordinal responses ranging from strongly agree (=1) to strongly disagree (=5). Here are aggregated distributions for valid responses on these two particular items:\nQ11E. people are willing to help their neighbors\n\nagree (=1,2): 74.4%\ndo not agree (=3,4,5): 25.6%\n\nQ11M. people can be trusted\n\nagree (=1,2): 60.1%\ndo not agree (=3,4,5): 39.9%\n\nThe KC community survey will contain many comparable items and, ultimately, we plan to use ordinal modeling techniques to assess differences in individual item response distributions like these across neighborhoods. Despite planning to build ordinal models, we anticipate our final public report will probably collapse and present dichotomous differences in the probability of reporting “agreement” (like the PHDCN aggregated example above) across at-risk and not-at-risk neighborhoods for accessible presentation to non-academic audiences. So, we want to take this into consideration when conducting a power analysis.1\nLet’s also assume that, with oversampling high risk neighborhoods, 50% of our sample is high risk (p1=0.50). This might be a high estimate (e.g., 50% of neighborhoods might not plausibly be considered for anti-crime interventions). However, examination of 2023 KC neighborhood crime rate data shows about 60% (149/237) of neighborhoods have single-digit violence crime rates per 1000 and about 40% (88/237) have double-digit violence rates. By design, 10 of the “at-risk” neighborhoods with the highest violence rates are included via oversampling. Then, stratified probability sampling procedures for identifying the other 30 neighborhoods is expected to yield another 10 “at risk” neighborhoods (78/227 = 0.34; 0.34*30 = 10.2), which would result in approximately an even split between “at risk” (double-digit violence rates) and “not at risk” neighborhoods in the KC sample. Note that, given funding and levels of concern, perhaps a smaller group is really under consideration for intervention at any given time; however, by overestimating and oversampling the “at risk” group (and thus assuming more equivalent group proportions), we anticipate generating more conservative power estimates (i.e., by maximizing variability).\nThus, for this a priori power analysis, we seek to estimate our statistical power to detect differences of varying magnitudes in analyses that are akin to those described above, given a fixed research design with the following parameters:\n\nalpha level of 0.05\ntotal n=800 participants\ntotal of 40 neighborhoods, with 20 participants per neighborhood\np(“at risk” neighborhood) = p(x=0) = 0.5\ngroup sizes of n1=400 and n2=400 (0.5*800)\n\nThough seemingly a simple question, this is somewhat complicated to determine given our anticipated models and estimands. As a result, instead of using power calculators, we will estimate power using a simulation approach.",

    "text": "13.3 Simulated data & model testing\nWith our simulation approach, we want to estimate whether ordinal response distributions (e.g., degree of agreement) differ across “at risk” (x=0) and “not at risk” (x=1) neighborhoods; for this, we will rely on ordinal (e.g., cumulative logit) regression thresholds and beta coefficients. Ultimately, we will collapse these ordinal distributions into dichotomies (e.g., “agree”/“not agree”) for the purposes of reporting basic differences across neighborhoods.\nLet’s first try to simulate some plausible data, then build a model and visualize the focal contrast. If we can do this, then we should be able to reiterate the process repeatedly under particular parameter settings to compare power estimates across effect sizes at fixed sample sizes and alpha levels. For this initial simulation, we start by assuming the true difference across groups is represented by an odds ratio of about 1.5, which would equate to a log odds coefficient of log(1.5) = 0.41.\nHow big is this difference? Well, let’s do some rough calculations to consider what this effect size (OR=1.5) might look like if we, say, subtract 0.03, from the probabilities reflected in those PHDCN items above to use as baseline probabilities (i.e., as the expected probability of agreement when x=0).\nQ11E. people are willing to help their neighbors\n\noverall probability of agreement: 0.75\nassumed baseline probability of agreement (when x=0): 0.72\nbaseline odds of agreement in x=0[at risk]: 0.72/0.28 = 2.57\nOdds of agreement in x=1[not at risk]: (2.57)x(1.5) = 3.86\nP(agree|x=0[at risk]) = odds/(1+odds) = 2.57/(1+2.57) = 0.72 (conversion works)\nP(agree|x=1[not at risk]) = odds/(1+odds) = 3.86/(1+3.86) = 0.79\np(agree|x=1) - p(agree|x=0) = 0.79 - 0.72 = .06 = 6 percentage point difference in “agreement” (i.e., y=1 and y=2) responses across groups\n\nQ11M. people can be trusted\n\noverall probability of agreement: 0.60\nassumed baseline probability of agreement (when x=0): 0.57\nassumed baseline odds of agreement: 0.57/0.43 = 1.33\nOdds of agreement in x=1[not at risk]: (1.33)x(1.5) = 2.0\nP(agree|x=0[at risk]) = odds/(1+odds) = 1.33/(1+1.33) = 0.57 (conversion works)\nP(agree|x=1[not at risk]) = odds/(1+odds) = 2.0/(1+2.0) = 0.67\np(agree|x=1) - p(agree|x=0) = 0.67 - 0.57 = .10 = 10 percentage point difference in “agreement” (i.e., y=1 and y=2) responses across groups\n\nSo, in this context, an OR=1.5 might be a small to medium difference on a probability scale (e.g., 6 to 10 percentage point absolute difference across groups), depending on the specific ordinal item response distributions.\nOne final word about assumptions. In our simulation below, we will assume baseline ordinal response distributions vary randomly across individuals and to a lesser extent neighborhoods, and responses are systematically “higher” (more agreeable) in not-at-risk neighborhoods (OR=1.5). Additionally, the PHDCN’s collective efficacy items showed higher “agreement” (strongly agree & agree) than “non-agreement” responses. So, in our simulation, items are reverse-coded such that our higher values equal greater agreement (or satisfaction or involvement), then cumulative logit cutpoints that are assymmetric around the middle category (y=3) are specified such that more probability mass is placed on the higher (agree) categories. Specifically, the cutpoints approximately translate to the following baseline probabilities:\n\np(SD or y=1) = 0.182\np(D or y=2) = 0.195\np(N or y=3) = 0.123\np(A or y=4) = 0.318\np(SA or y=5) = 0.182\n\nThese baseline probabilities correspond to the following cumulative logit cutpoints:\n\n\nShow code\ncumulative_probs &lt;- c(0.182, 0.377, 0.5, 0.818)\n\n# Calculate cutpoints using the inverse logit function (qlogis)\ncutpoints &lt;- qlogis(cumulative_probs)\n\n# Print the cutpoints\ncutpoints\n\n\n[1] -1.5028556 -0.5023013  0.0000000  1.5028556\n\n\n\ncp1 = 0.182; cutpoint = -1.5\ncp2 = 0.377; cutpoint = -0.5\ncp3 = 0.5; cutpoint = 0\ncp4 = 0.818; cutpoint = 1.5\n\nNow, let’s try simulating one dataset to see if we can estimate power given these assumptions.\n\n13.3.1 example sim to test\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(ordinal)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(1138)\n\n# Set the parameters\nn_neigh &lt;- 40  # Number of neighborhoods\nn_ind &lt;- 20    # Number of individuals per neighborhood\nn &lt;- n_neigh * n_ind  # Total number of individuals\nbeta0 &lt;- 0     # Intercept\nbeta1 &lt;- log(1.5)  # Effect size (log-odds for binary x)\nsigma_neigh &lt;- .25  # Neighborhood random effect standard deviation\nsigma_ind &lt;- 1  # Individual-level noise\n\n# Simulate binary predictor ensuring equal split\nx_neigh &lt;- rep(c(0, 1), each = n_neigh / 2)  # 20 \"at risk\" and 20 \"not at risk\"\n\n# Simulate neighborhood IDs\nneigh_id &lt;- rep(1:n_neigh, each = n_ind)\n\n# Assign neighborhood-level x to individuals\nx &lt;- rep(x_neigh, each = n_ind)\n\n# Generate neighborhood-level random intercepts\nneigh_intercept &lt;- rnorm(n_neigh, mean = 0, sd = sigma_neigh)\n\n# Individual-level noise\nind_noise &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma_ind)\n\n# Linear predictor (latent continuous variable)\nlinpred &lt;- beta0 + beta1 * x + neigh_intercept[neigh_id] + ind_noise\n\n# Cut points (thresholds) for the ordinal outcome (logit-scale)\ncutpoints &lt;- c(-1.5, -0.5, 0, 1.5)\n\n# Use the cut() function to assign categories\ny &lt;- cut(linpred, breaks = c(-Inf, cutpoints, Inf), labels = 1:5, ordered_result = TRUE)\n\n# Combine into a data frame\nsimdat &lt;- data.frame(\n  neigh_id = neigh_id,\n  x = factor(x),  # Binary neighborhood predictor as factor\n  y = factor(y, ordered = TRUE)  # Ordinal response variable\n)\n\n# Check distribution\nprint(\"Distribution of x:\")\n\n\n[1] \"Distribution of x:\"\n\n\nShow code\nprint(table(simdat$x))\n\n\n\n  0   1 \n400 400 \n\n\nShow code\nprint(\"Distribution of y:\")\n\n\n[1] \"Distribution of y:\"\n\n\nShow code\nprint(table(simdat$y))\n\n\n\n  1   2   3   4   5 \n 30 164 152 374  80 \n\n\nWe have data! Now, let’s visualize the differences in ordinal distributions across groups using a mosaic plot.\n\n\n13.3.2 visualize ordinal distribution contrast\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(ggmosaic)\nlibrary(viridis)\n\nmosyplot &lt;- function(df, yvar, xvar, xlabel, ylabel, mytitle, mysubtitle){\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_mosaic(data=df, aes(x = product(!!as.name(yvar), !!as.name(xvar)), fill = !!as.name(yvar)),\n              na.rm=TRUE) +\n  labs(x = xlabel,\n       y = ylabel,\n       title=mytitle,\n       subtitle = mysubtitle) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin=.1, end=.9, direction=-1,\n                       option=\"magma\", \n                       guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank())\n  }\n\nordplot &lt;- mosyplot(df=simdat, \"y\", \"x\", \"Neighborhood risk\",\n         \"Proportion satisfied\", \"Mosaic plot y by x\",\n         \"Left to Right = (0) at risk / (1) not at risk\"\n)\nordplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything appears to have worked, and it appears from this graph that the “not at risk” (x=1) neighborhood group actually shows greater overall agreement responses (y=4,5) than the “at risk” (x=0) neighborhoods. It is not clear whether these observed differences recovered the specified parameter’s magnitude (OR=1.5). Let’s fit a cumulative logit model with a neighborhood risk predictor and a neighborhood random effect to estimate the effect in this particular sample.\n\n\n13.3.3 build (frequentist) model\n\n\nShow code\n# Fit the cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) with neighborhood random effects\nfit &lt;- clmm(y ~ x + (1 | neigh_id), data = simdat)\nsummary(fit)\n\n\nCumulative Link Mixed Model fitted with the Laplace approximation\n\nformula: y ~ x + (1 | neigh_id)\ndata:    simdat\n\n link  threshold nobs logLik   AIC     niter    max.grad cond.H \n logit flexible  800  -1072.19 2156.39 319(648) 2.74e-05 1.9e+02\n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n neigh_id (Intercept) 0.0382   0.1954  \nNumber of groups:  neigh_id 40 \n\nCoefficients:\n   Estimate Std.

This is close to recovering our simulated parameter of log(1.5).\nThe coefficient is also statistically significant at alpha=0.05. But, this is one sample, and the estimate is a little larger than the parameter. Is our design able to reliably estimate confidence intervals that will contain an effect of OR=1.5 at an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power?",

Perhaps we are generating too much random variation that, when applied to non-uniform baseline probabilities that cluster towards higher values, result in distributions that pull our beta estimates upwards? I am not entirely sure here, but let’s continue on.\n\n\n13.4.3 collapsing & presenting dichotomous results\nRecall, ultimately we want to compare probability of “agree” (y=4,5) versus “not agree” (1-3) categories across neighborhoods.

Let’s plot this contrast.\n\n\nShow code\n# Plot the proportion of high agreement responses by neighborhood type\nggplot(high_agreement_summary, aes(x = as.factor(x), y = high_agreement_proportion, fill = as.factor(x))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.7, fill=c(\"maroon\", \"darkgrey\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion Agree Responses by Nbhd Risk\",\n    x = \"Neighborhood Risk\",\n    y = \"Proportion Agree Responses\",\n    fill = \"Neighborhood Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"At Risk\", \"1\" = \"Not at Risk\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, though the OR=1.5 and distributions varied, in this example the difference in probability of reporting “satisfied” categories is about 0.125 across neighborhood risk groups.\nRecall, this is the type of contrast that we are likely to want to include for various item responses in our final report. We will return to this type of presentation later. First, let’s see if we can adjust our analysis to generate a power curve that displayes estimated power across different plausible effect magnitudes (odds ratios).\n\n\n13.4.4 est. power across different plausible effect sizes\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\n# Set up future for parallel processing\nplan(multisession)  # or multicore depending on system\n\n# Set simulation parameters\nn_sim &lt;- 100  # Number of simulations\nalpha &lt;- 0.05  # Significance level for hypothesis test\neffect_sizes &lt;- log(c(1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2))  # Different effect sizes to test (log-odds)\n\n# Set other parameters for each simulation\nn_neigh &lt;- 40  # Number of neighborhoods\nn_ind &lt;- 20    # Number of individuals per neighborhood\nn &lt;- n_neigh * n_ind  # Total number of individuals\nsigma_neigh &lt;- 0.25  # Neighborhood random effect standard deviation\nsigma_ind &lt;- 1  # Individual-level noise\n\n# Define the simulation function\nrun_simulation &lt;- function(beta1) {\n  tryCatch({\n    # Simulate binary predictor ensuring equal split\n    x_neigh &lt;- rep(c(0, 1), each = n_neigh / 2)  # 20 \"at risk\" and 20 \"not at risk\"\n    \n    # Simulate neighborhood IDs\n    neigh_id &lt;- rep(1:n_neigh, each = n_ind)\n    \n    # Assign neighborhood-level x to individuals\n    x &lt;- rep(x_neigh, each = n_ind)\n    \n    # Generate neighborhood-level random intercepts\n    neigh_intercept &lt;- rnorm(n_neigh, mean = 0, sd = sigma_neigh)\n    \n    # Individual-level noise\n    ind_noise &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma_ind)\n    \n    # Linear predictor (latent continuous variable)\n    linpred &lt;- beta1 * x + neigh_intercept[neigh_id] + ind_noise\n    \n    # Cut points (thresholds) for the ordinal outcome (logit-scale)\n    cutpoints &lt;- c(-1.5, -0.5, 0, 1.5)\n    \n    # Use the cut() function to assign categories\n    y &lt;- cut(linpred, breaks = c(-Inf, cutpoints, Inf), labels = 1:5, ordered_result = TRUE)\n    \n    # Combine into a data frame\n    simdat &lt;- data.frame(\n      neigh_id = neigh_id,\n      x = factor(x),  # Binary neighborhood predictor as factor\n      y = factor(y, ordered = TRUE)  # Ordinal response variable\n    )\n    \n    # Fit the cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) with neighborhood random effects\n    fit &lt;- clmm(y ~ x + (1 | neigh_id), data = simdat, control = clmm.control(maxIter = 100))\n    \n    # Extract the p-value for the predictor 'x'\n    p_value &lt;- summary(fit)$coefficients[\"x1\", \"Pr(&gt;|z|)\"]\n    \n    return(p_value)\n  }, error = function(e) {\n    # Return NA if any error occurs (model didn't fit)\n    return(NA)\n  })\n}\n\n# Function to estimate power for a given effect size\nestimate_power &lt;- function(beta1) {\n  p_values &lt;- future_map(1:n_sim, ~ run_simulation(beta1), .options = furrr_options(seed = TRUE))\n  \n  # Filter out NA values and count significant results\n  valid_p_values &lt;- p_values[!is.na(p_values)]\n  significant_count &lt;- sum(valid_p_values &lt; alpha)\n  \n  # Calculate power as the proportion of significant results\n  power &lt;- significant_count / length(valid_p_values)\n  \n  return(power)\n}\n\n# Estimate power for different effect sizes\npower_results &lt;- future_map_dbl(effect_sizes, estimate_power, .options = furrr_options(seed = TRUE))\n\n# Combine effect sizes and power results into a data frame\npower_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  effect_size = effect_sizes,\n  power = power_results\n)\n\n# Plot power by effect size\nggplot(power_df, aes(x = exp(effect_size), y = power)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"maroon\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"black\", size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Effect Size (Odds Ratio)\",\n    y = \"Power\",\n    title = \"Statistical Power by Effect Size\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our simulation and modeling assumptions are reasonable then, based on this plot, our research design affords an estimated &gt;=80% power to detect effects approximately OR=1.35 or larger at an alpha level of 0.05.\n\n\n13.4.5 visualizing minimum detectable effect at est. 80% power (OR=1.35)\nOne more thing. How large might an odds ratio of 1.35 be in a predicted probability metric? We can estimate and plot such hypothetical differences using the baseline response probability thresholds specified in the simulation. Let’s do this with a full ordinal distribution and after collapsing categories into dichotomous agree/not agree response distributions. This will help us visualize the magnitude of hypothetical contrasts that we might have sufficient power to detect in this study.\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Thresholds (cutpoints) from the simulation\nthresholds &lt;- c(-1.5, -0.5, 0, 1.5)\n\n# Effect size (log odds for x=1)\nlog_odds_ratio &lt;- log(1.35)\n\n# Linear predictor for x=0 (at risk) and x=1 (not at risk)\neta_0 &lt;- 0\neta_1 &lt;- log_odds_ratio\n\n# Logistic function to calculate cumulative probabilities\nlogistic &lt;- function(x) {\n  return(1 / (1 + exp(-x)))\n}\n\n# Calculate cumulative probabilities for each group\ncum_probs_0 &lt;- logistic(thresholds - eta_0)\ncum_probs_1 &lt;- logistic(thresholds - eta_1)\n\n# Calculate predicted probabilities (P(y = k))\nprobs_0 &lt;- c(cum_probs_0[1], diff(cum_probs_0), 1 - cum_probs_0[4])\nprobs_1 &lt;- c(cum_probs_1[1], diff(cum_probs_1), 1 - cum_probs_1[4])\n\n# Collapse the categories y = 1,2,3 and y = 4,5\ncollapsed_probs_0 &lt;- c(sum(probs_0[1:3]), sum(probs_0[4:5]))\ncollapsed_probs_1 &lt;- c(sum(probs_1[1:3]), sum(probs_1[4:5]))\n\n# Create a data frame for full ordinal plot\npred_prob_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  category = factor(1:5),\n  prob_x0 = probs_0,  # At risk (x=0)\n  prob_x1 = probs_1   # Not at risk (x=1)\n) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"prob\"), names_to = \"group\", values_to = \"probability\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = recode(group, \"prob_x0\" = \"At Risk (x=0)\", \"prob_x1\" = \"Not at Risk (x=1)\"))\n\n# Create a data frame for the collapsed categories\ncollapsed_prob_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  category = factor(c(\"y=1,2,3\", \"y=4,5\")),\n  prob_x0 = collapsed_probs_0,  # At risk (x=0)\n  prob_x1 = collapsed_probs_1   # Not at risk (x=1)\n) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"prob\"), names_to = \"group\", values_to = \"probability\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = recode(group, \"prob_x0\" = \"At Risk (x=0)\", \"prob_x1\" = \"Not at Risk (x=1)\"))\n\n# Plot full predicted probabilities for x=0 and x=1\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(pred_prob_df, aes(x = category, y = probability, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"maroon\", \"darkgrey\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Ordinal Outcome (y)\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Plot collapsed predicted probabilities for x=0 and x=1\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(collapsed_prob_df, aes(x = category, y = probability, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"maroon\", \"darkgrey\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Collapsed Ordinal Outcome\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplot1 + plot2 + \n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") +\n   plot_annotation(\n     title = \"Simulated Pred.

    "text": "For the sake of transparency, we do not think statistical power estimates or statistical inferences based on null hypothesis significance testing are usually very useful in typical quantitative applications in our field. To be sure, they are quite important in fields and applications where researchers are testing a small number of very precisely articulated (point, range, or equivalence) hypotheses, usually with experimental or quasi-experimental designs, and where prior tests exist that can provide precise information to inform assumptions about things like expected baseline probabilities, individual- and group-level variation, and smallest effect size of interest in context, in addition to (especially in observational designs) well-articulated causal theoretical expectations about potential confounds, mediators, effect heterogeneity and moderators, and so on. In contexts lacking precise hypotheses to test and precise prior information to inform tests and designs, we are skeptical that the numeric quantities generated by an a priori power analysis are likely to precisely match the true power of any subsequent “test” - particularly because such research at best is likely to generate theoretically-informed descriptive inferences rather than strict hypothesis tests. With that said, we realize that researchers often are encouraged or required to conduct a priori power analysis, and we certainly see value in thinking through one’s design, anticipated data, intended modeling approach, desired estimand, and related assumptions following from these decisions and practices. So, despite our typical reservations, we gave it the old college try.↩︎",
