![Two lemmings confused by exposure-mediator interactions (with help from DALL-E)](med-or-mod-cartoon2.jpg)

You have reached the future page for the second of a two-part blog series on issues related to modeling moderating relationships or testing interaction effects with criminological data. 

In [Part 1](https://reluctantcriminologists.com/blog-posts/[6]/modmadness-pt1.html), I covered issues related to estimating and interpreting interaction effects with binary or skewed count outcome variables. In Part 2, I plan to introduce the need and a method for disentangling indirect and interaction effects in the presence of a potential exposure-mediator interaction.

This page is a stub. I hope to complete Part 2 soon so all one of you can read it. At least you got both a mom joke and self-deprecating humor while you wait. Hi Mom!
