You have reached the future page for the third of a three-part blog series on issues related to modeling moderating relationships or testing interaction effects with criminological data. 

This is the third and final entry in a three-part blog series on modeling moderators in criminological data. In [Part 1](https://reluctantcriminologists.com/blog-posts/[6]/modmadness-pt1.html), I covered issues related to estimating and interpreting interaction effects with binary or skewed count outcome variables. In [Part 2](https://reluctantcriminologists.com/blog-posts/[7]/modmadness-pt2.html), I introduced counterfactual causality, exposure-mediator interactions, and a potential outcomes framework for conducting a four-way decomposition of a total effect into controlled direct effect (*CDE*), pure indirect effect (*PIE*), reference interaction (*INT~ref~*), and mediated interaction (*INT~med~*) components. 

In this final entry, I illustrate how to use the `CMAverse` software package in R to conduct "causal mediation" analysis, which relies on the 4-way potential outcomes decomposition introduced in [Part 2](https://reluctantcriminologists.com/blog-posts/[7]/modmadness-pt2.html) to disentangle indirect and interaction effects in the presence of a potential exposure-mediator interaction.[^Theory-note] Along the way, I will also introduce the important assumptions required to interpret "causal mediation" results as estimates of causal effects.
